Are the laws different for different types of ICOs? I slacked off on making a BTER account <img src="https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /><br /></div><br />As stated previously, Poloniex sought advice from their lawyers regarding IPO/ICO&#039;s as a direct result of people posting in this thread their concerns that it might contravene SEC rules in the US. They were advised by their legal team not to proceed with the superNET ICO and, having been made aware of the potential complications, could not risk hosting it.<br /><br />I think you&#039;ll now find that Poloniex will not be permitting any more ICO&#039;s until they receive legal confirmation that it is safe to do so without falling foul of the regulatory environment they operate in, as a US-based exchange.<br /></div><br />That did not answer my question. Let me rephrase the question.<br /><br />Did Poloniex seek their lawyers&#039; input while conducting QIBUCK ICO? <br /><br />1) Yes they did seek, and the lawyers said yes proceed.<br />2) Yes they did seek, and the lawyers said no cannot proceed.<br />3) No they did not seek, and conducted QIBUCK ICO.<br />4) No they did not seek, and did not conduct QIBUCK ICO.<br /><br />In case of 3) I can see a big problem already that they were trying to avoid in the first place. <br /></div>this is not poloniex thread</div>

So first you say its Keiretsu, I demolish that. Then you accuse me of &quot;not understanding your grand plans&quot;. I say ok, answer three questions. Again you avoid answering questions and make up some BS story. Let me take your own post apart:<br /><br />&quot;Please do not just make up something and present it like a fact.<br />txids 13869109530637325948 and 18177681832696022121 are for 500 and 24500 NXTprivacy assets from my personal acct <b>NXT-DE2F-W76R-GL25-HMFPR into the BTCD donation acct <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NXT-EVK5-KLZV-NHSZ-H4Z7R</span></b><br />So you falsely accuse me of taking assets from the JLH account all the while pretending you are being factual.&quot;<br /><br />The JLH issuing account is - NXT-DE2F-W76R-GL25-HMFPR, which I guess was the JLH account. But now you say its your personal account. As you say I am &quot;making&quot; things up, so:<br />1. Why use a personal account as the issuing account? I have checked your other assets InstaDex and sharkfund0, these werent done from this account? <br />2. If this is your personal account, pray where you are holding jl777&#039;s coins/assets? The account name? Can you state the facts for me please? <br /></div>The account that issues an asset is simply the account that issues the asset. Sometimes I issue an asset from the operation asset&#039;s account. For example, the SuperNET acct NXT-MRBN-8DFH-PFMK-A4DBM is the one that issued the TOKEN asset 15641806960898178066. I issued the jl777hodl asset from my jl777 account because it made sense to me to do so. There is no requirement for this, for some strange reason I felt that issuing the jl777hodl asset from the jl777 account was a reasonable thing to do. What about this is unreasonable to you and makes you write in a accusatory tone. All you have to do is ask me about this, without couching it in terms to make me look like I am doing something unethical. Now, since the JLH (jl777hodl abbreviated) is going to be holding assets I certainly dont want to be commingling anything into it, so I created an acct just for this purpose and this is described in the asset description. this acct is NXT-2AHU-UXZW-K9Q2-HENLW.<br /><br />So it seems that you started with the conclusion that I am a crook and are searching for &quot;facts&quot; that fit this theory. This is bad scientific method. The proper way is to form the theory that jl777 is a crook and then gather data to see if it confirms or denies this fact. So far all we have is confirmation that you mistakenly assumed that my personal acct was the JLH acct and the fact that I am using my personal acct for doing personal things like donating $33,000 USD worth of NXTprivacy to the BTCD community.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">BBR and the sharkfund0 -- &quot;Boolberry�s market cap stands at around $400,000 and a 10 percent share � already obtained by sharkfund0, most of which will be going into the SuperNET core � would cost only 80 BTC.&quot; -- from your pdf. Now how can one read this, tell me? Two ways:<br /><br />1. You are investing coins from sharkfund0 into supernet, market rate or not, doesn&#039;t matter. Effectively propping Supernet with watever btc (4k BTC, was it?) sharkfund0 has. A market news of Supernet raising say 7k BTC (doesn&#039;t matter if it contains 4k BTC from sharkfund0, is a market moving news, isnt?)<br /><br />2. You are investing a percentage of the sharkfund0 into supernet (keeping in with the risk mitigation and all). Say 40% of sharkfund0 --- that wud amount to only effective 4% of BBR being invested. Wouldn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Now as you clarified (or provided proof <img src="https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> ) that you will be investing your personal sharkfund0. Fair enough. How much do you hold? And how much of BBR wud it represent? Not 10% for sure. <br /></div>The text you quote is from an older version, cassius wrote the document and I missed the potential confusion, so as soon as somebody else pointed this out we modified it. If this text is still in the current version then I must have made a mistake in the uploading. I was having many connection problems that day (and most days). So I apologize for this error, I believe it has been corrected and you have an older doc. as far as my percentage of sharkfund, you can just look in the acct: <a class="ul" href="http://nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-SQ9J-JCAN-8XVY-5XN7K&amp;c=USD">http://nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-SQ9J-JCAN-8XVY-5XN7K&amp;c=USD</a><br />I have 521 sharkfund0 right now. I used to have 800+, but in order to pay for core assets held by the various operating assets, I had to swap a all my NXTventure, JLH and a big chunk of my sharkfund. I did most transfers within a few minutes, but there was one that had some hours gap. I forget the exact swap, but half was pending for some few hours. Now I am rounding, so when I see 6989495 or something like that I round it to 7 mil. It could be that for some marketrate swaps I am guilty of some fractional gains due to this rounding. If this is an issue, please specify which swaps I am guilty of having benefited from and I will refund the difference. Though, it would only seem fair that in the cases the rounding error went against me, I should get a credit, so I ask that you calculate all these roundings and the net difference between myself and the various assets, and this I will refund. Let me know if you think that is fair.<br /><br />Considering your confusions, maybe the NXTsharks acct NXT-ZWW7-PSXW-89TR-AA67Z is not known to you. This is the acct that issued the sharkfund0 and if you look at it you will see that it has 8&#039;625.0026 sharkfund0 assets. But these are assets that it has issued and not sold. You can also find out that a total of 10000 sharkfund0 were issued, so subtracting them we get 1374.9974 sharkfund0 which makes my 512 to be 37.236434047075% of the total. So if all these sharkfund0 goes into the SuperNET, then 3.7% of BBR is in the SuperNET. However, the actual total is higher as the other assets that I swapped the sharkfund0 with are having more of the sharkfund0, so we will get more contributions indirectly. i dont have a way to estimate the exact figure, due to uncertainity as to the total core assets to be put into the SuperNET, but it will probably end up being around 5%. If the 10% amount is something that you are feeling strongly that is needed, this could be solved by using the proceeds to directly purchase the 5%<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">I have a theory for Mgw but lets not talk about it as it will piss you off more. <img src="https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /><br /></div>Since I own very little MGW, you will have to be quite creative to make me look like I am being unethical after I gave away about half of MGW to around a dozen people and sold most of the rest at half the market price. There is the 10% in JLH and I have some small amount I believe, but I think I am controlling less than 5% of MGW now. The way I determined the market price was by making a price ladder for MGW and the sales of anything at 5 was gone very fast. Then when it got to 7, it still happened, but not so fast, so I took the conservative number of 5 as the market price, even though I could have justified 7. Then I reduced it to 2.5 and sold it in small batches. To be fair to the people that &quot;overpaid&quot;, I calculated the amount they should have gotten if the price was 2.5 vs. what they actually paid and transferred this to each account. [this does sound very familiar!]. Since you probably dont believe me about this, please research the trade history of MGW.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">That all said, you say I declined your offer to do any real work. I already asked you some questions. Let me repeat them again:<br />a. What is your holding pattern in each of the assets? This will clarify how much of your one asset is owned by another asset. ie answer the ponzi query clearly. --&gt; Or do you want me to dig up info which you should be having already?<br /></div>You are using a word that is indicating fraud, this I take offense at. Now the ponzi is an unsustainable system where the existing owners are paid by the new buyers and the only way this can keep working is to always get new buyers. I didnt bother to answer your accusation of fraud as this is nonsensical when applied to my assets. I am not selling the asset promising returns of X% and funding this X% return by selling more assets. Since you continue to accuse me of fraud with no basis, I suggest you can do your own homeworks to fund out which of my assets are owning which of the other assets using the blockchain. I have better things to do than make reports when the reports are already there for everybody to see. So, one asset owning another is not a ponzi and yes you should &quot;dig&quot; up this info because I dont do GUI. If the data is already there for everyone what use is it for me to waste my time on it?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">b. Even if you are consider these linked assets as Keiretsu, how do you mitigate the single point of risk - YOU. Not only from a scam point of view but also from unforeseen events too - say an IRL issues, many of us have those. &nbsp;--&gt; This is more out of concern for you and people both. But fuck it, why have a contingency plan when you are the great jl777 --- no one should question you.<br />c. If your answer to above is &quot;escrow&quot;, then who/what will be holding the &quot;escrow&quot;. What are the terms? I have gone through the pdf and don&#039;t see the escrow terms. <br /></div>I have written my contingency plan and it is in this thread and since you continue you accusatory tone even after my continue requests to use this &quot;innocent until proven&quot; guilty philosophy and also that you have only demonstrated my generous donations and your lack of understanding of how the NXT assets are working (this is ok, but you should understand the facts before jumping to conclusions). I have stated that this thread contains the latest up to date info, this is an obvious thing as this is the official SuperNET thread, where else would the latest info be? So, generally speaking I am getting direct access to 1% of the funds, which is about 30 BTC at current levels and in this case putting in 300BTC, so I would be losing access to ~270 BTC. For this, I dont thing any contingency plan is needed as if something is happening to me, the SuperNET is gaining 270 BTC. For the other 99%, I have stated that we are going to have to find the escrow methods during the fund raising process, which is 2 to 4 weeks from now. Since I am not getting access to most of the funds, I though this would be acceptable.<br /><br />The wrinkle was that an unexpected amount of NXT came in via AE (20 million NXT!) and I have had personal access to this 1600 BTC all day. You can see that it is all still there. I could have just disappeared with 1600 BTC, yet I continue to tolerate all these questions which could have been asked in a respectful manner that I feel I have earned. I think that I have at least earned the right to not be interrogated like some crook, but rather just asked factual questions without biasing the reader by using words like &quot;ponzi&quot; when it has no behavior like ponzi that I can even think of. Anyway, you probably didnt even bother to read the post I made about finding the NXT community escrows for this 20 million. Since I figured the people like you will feel that I am a flight risk with all this NXT, I thought it best to get it taken care of as soon as possible. Just think, 1600 BTC just there and all I have to do is go send NXT and its gone. Does it affect your opinion at all that I could have already taken all this money, but havent and instead am spending all this effort answering your accusatories? The community is making a discussion on who in the community should be holding this and I am not participating in it so as not to be accussed of tampering with the selection process.<br /><br />The process to get money out of escrow is described, but I know you are kind of lazy and dont like to do much reading so I will repeat it. For the previously defined (and updated by this thread) uses of the funds that were prior to the first funds being received, a post to this thread that conforms to these defined uses will be all that is required. Then one of the trustees posts that they approve it and then they get confirmed as the one to pay, then they pay. This avoids the possibility of double payment. the procedure is open for all to see. If anything suspicious is happening, I am assuming somebody would protest and then we will use common sense to resolve such matters. I do not have to be specifically involved in these things if it is following the right procedures, but I would think that most trustees would wait for confirmation from me to prevent some random person trying to spend the escrowed funds. All the procedures are not spelled out as SuperNET is not a fiat based corporation, it is a crypto organization. We will use common sense and logic to resolve things.<br /><br />Now if you had read the official thread you would have also seen that for non-standard expenses, there is a decentralized voting that will be used to approve or decline the spending request. There are three threshold levels 50%, 2/3rds and 90%, the threshold needed is specified in the voting info. if there is some controversy over this, we have a majority wins prevote for the three thresholds and the ones with the most weight is the threshold that is used. The voting weight is the number of SuperNXT assets one has.<br /><br />The proposing of the vote is something that will probably need to be filtered and at first I imagine that I would be the one to formally propose a funding vote. However, there is no reason this has to be me, as soon as somebody has some good ideas for funding, they should post it here. If I am sensing that the community is divided over the issue I would be compelled to hold a vote. Now this function is really something anybody can do. You just have to notice that either everybody is agreeing or not. So this is one task I look forward to have somebody else do.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">It has been quite apparent from the syscoin, another IPO I bought into, that the escrow in crypto space is corrupt. slex has been changing terms for that escrow as and when he likes. worst part, his contention was wallet and blockchain, even in non-working form was enough for him to hold the coins. &nbsp;--&gt; If I remember correctly you were still looking for escrow options. Things weren&#039;t finalised before the IPO kicked off. Now can we get some clarity? <br /></div>If you read this thread and I think the other investors would prefer that you spend an hour reading the thread than me spending two hours responding to questions that would have been answered had you read the thread, you will find that the method for escrow requires that one of the distributed escrow holders accepts the spending request and presumably requiring the appropriate documentation. In cases where there are sensitive details the common sense thing to do is PM the sensitive details and redact the public post. If the spending request is appropriate, the trustee posts his approval and then gets a confirmation to spend. this is a treasurer function and another task that I do not need to be involved in, though the original request for funding is probably something I will always be doing as this is of critical importance, to know where the money is going. We are in the process of doing this for the NXT. I also posted in this thread, but nobody has followed up on it yet. In any case the amount of NXT raised is surprisingly a bit more than half the total so it makes sense to take care of that first. If we cannot find the BTC trustees, I am sure we can have the NXT trustees also hold some BTC too.<br /><br />I am also planning on using companies like Xapo and Coinbase for some portion, bter for another, but for this we have 2 to 4 weeks yet to solve and not knowing the magnitude of the offering, it is not possible to make any coherent plans. I would not have predicted 26 million NXT would come in the first day, so any plan made would have been wrong. I like to be efficient and solve the problems that need solving and using my experience, judgement and common sense to figure out the best thing to do.<br /><br />Another example, regardless of all the planning, anything complicated will never go as planned. During the opening both in the NXT AE and on all the bter markets except for the BTCD one, people bid huge amounts and way above the official price. I have predicted SuperNET would raise around 10K BTC, and many have called me crazy, but since the only people that knew of it are small crypto community with just one week from ANN and on a saturday, I did not expect any giant volumes. Certainly not that the first hour would have more volume than etherium&#039;s first hour. Here are the numbers. 10,000 in 28 days is 357 BTC per day, spread across five markets we are looking at about 3 BTC per hour average. Of course the largest market would have more than the average, lets say 10 BTC per hour. The parameters were set to 10 BTC per minute per trading pair. So this is 60 times the average rate and it turned out I was off by nearly a factor of 100 as I think we got more than 1000 BTC right at the very beginning. It was quite chaotic and kind of a blur now. Anyway, this combined with allowing the resale of TOKEN (based on user requests) allowed some shrewd buyers to flip it at 2x or more instantly.<br /><br />This made for some very happy flippers, but for many unhappy buyers who didnt check the official price and just bought what was on the orderbook. There were some of the opinion that the buyer bid for it, so they got what they wanted, but I decided that the right thing to do was to issue some additional TOKEN to make it so all purchasers end up paying the official price. This was my mistake, so I offered to pay from my own pocket if the investors felt that they did not want to suffer from the slight dilution these compensations would cause. I dont have the exact figure but I believe the total dilution will be around 2000 TOKEN or 20 BTC, so if the investors decide they dont want to absorb this, then it comes out of my pocket, but I wont take it from the 30 BTC from the 1% as that is needed for the incidental costs and this is not what I meant by incidental costs for the 1%<br /><br />This is how I work. I dont waste my time thinking about the zillion things that can happen and make a 1000 page document that will not even cover what is important anyway. That is fiat mentality where it is believe that the universe can be predicted and controlled. I believe it is better to be mentally fit and agile and be able to deal with anything that happens in a calm and logical way using common sense and compassion as a guide.<br /><br />I am the anti-lawyer<br /><br />James</div>

Being anonymous like you are going to be, provides zero credibility to vericoin. Infact the one thing you claim vericoin has, that you need, is now being muddied by your own undertaking of this coin in your &quot;anon&quot; roll.<br /><br />I was under the impression you would be a public figure #4, just like dev 1,2,3.

He was always trying to trick me to reveal my voice or reveal my location, i hope he spent a lot of money to go to where I pretended to be.<br /><br />So, all the investors would have lost this 1 million NXT. Since he wouldnt do the right thing, I did. I swapped all the investors useless asset that encapsulated this real world known guys work with marketrate equiv JLH. The JLH has more than doubled since then so all the investors came out at least breakeven, most with nice profits.<br /><br />That is my identity. That is who I am. Somebody you can count on to do the right thing, always.<br /><br />Now I think you are part of this group that is trying to uncover my identity. you are bribing people with 10 BTC just for any info. since you were careful this time and did not slander you avoid the SHUN. But remember you are on warning, one more troll post and you will be shunned.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. This scammer said, &quot;you know who I am, what are you going to do sue me&quot;? <br /></div><br /><br />Buy4crypto is skeptical&nbsp; but not out to get you. <br /><br />Being anon for this reason is understandable.&nbsp; I was contemplating this myself for protection of my family. However I decided if there is no discovering to do not much searching will be done. This is a personal choice. <br /></div>Well, just because I&#039;m paranoid doesnt mean they are not after me.<br />Anyway, I say I dont need the money, but people even doubt this so: <a class="ul" href="http://nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-SQ9J-JCAN-8XVY-5XN7K&amp;c=USD">http://nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-SQ9J-JCAN-8XVY-5XN7K&amp;c=USD</a><br /><br />this shows 87 million NXT which is &gt;$3 mil, I seem to have gained $1 mil over last 2 weeks. Nice surprise<br />now some will say anybody can just post that link there is no proof you control it.<br /><br />ma4nd5f5er1kieukm2uf45q3cko55vh2h5gsuha2abgjnpiefa5vgvu9vs5l3qo10u3sofrtoo59pb2<span style="width: 0; margin: 0 -0.6ex 0 -1px;"> </span>se0umuea3dbujejg5bg4tg895s15gf11cevns1m8t2pmgu2cv40q821v2n8bu1lb7806u930n4us1th<span style="width: 0; margin: 0 -0.6ex 0 -1px;"> </span>31<br /><br />That is a NXT token that I just generated from the 87 mil NXT acct, the text I used was<br />VRC<br /><br />Anybody running NXT can decode this token to verify that I do indeed control that acct.<br /><br />OK, so what else. I am doing it for the money. Since making a million USD in a week isnt enough, the theory is I want to work for 6 to 9 months to help 10x VRC and maintain it for years so I make another million USD. Or maybe I am not a money motivated person. I know this is abnormal and just not possible, but then again most would have said to raise 3000 BTC within one week of starting a thread with only text and no fancy anything is impossible.<br /><br />So, this crypto is shattered and fragmented and this is maybe an accident or maybe not. The SuperNET it makes all the coins that join stronger. Even the ones that are just using it. The SuperNET cant really threaten a coin, because it is not a coin. It is enabling all computers to connect, like the internet connecting websites. SuperNET connects coins. A website isnt threatened by the internet, nowadays we know the websites they need the internet. A lot of you are feeling some powerful &quot;memory&quot; when you are hearing of the SuperNET. It is like it has already existed, but this is strange because it is just being constructed.<br /><br />It is just a theory of mine that when many people are knowing of the same thing, it creates an echo and this travels, maybe even a bit backward in time. Maybe tachyons are involved to allow the scientific peoples to be open to this possibility. We have many gaps in our knowledge about what is and isnt possible with physics, the human mind, group consciousness. Maybe there is a force that binds us all?<br /><br />Regardless, maybe it is as simple as the fact that we all know that 592 altcoins all incompatible is quite silly and pointless. We all want to make our own home, our own community and until now, this meant an unplugged coin. So, with the simple idea (I am no genius to know the altcoins must join) to an obvious problem, it seems like it is familiar, the right answer.<br /><br />There have been dozens of coins that are all wanting to join or understand how to connect to the SuperNET, even some of the top coins, so clearly this is the problem that was waiting for the solution.<br /><br />This is a group effort, within each coin, with all the coins.<br /><br />If anybody still has doubts, please think back to before we had the internet to connect the websites together, or look up this time in the history.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. OK, that was a trick question, there were no websites before the internet, it was nonsensical to have some html on an unplugged computer. However, there were things like store catalogs that you can browse for the shopping in the big stores. This is where the crypto is now.</div>

Truth and logic. These are things that are like the holy water to the vampires. Any troll that is not a sockpuppet that dares to troll in any of my homes is risking total loss of whatever credibility they have and even to be featured on the OP of the SuperNET thread (which should be quite a popular thread) along with a post in my widely followed blog.<br /><br />They come here to spread fear and doubt with logicless propaganda, they leave with shame and public shunning. So, if everyone here will all just put on ignore the trolls on my ignorelist, then we can be totally immune to their attempts at manipulation. I will be proposing this in all my homes so we can conduct our lives without having to live with garbage all over the place.<br /><br />So, many are putting in the 10%, this is good, but it seems only 20% have put in the 10%, so there is still more to go. Let us not be greedy, let us all &quot;sacrifice&quot; 10%. I will put 100% of my VRC in. Now we cannot force everybody to put in 10%, but we know that 10% of the total is to the exact amount, so until it is reached this we are having freeloaders.<br /><br />Now if you are ok with being a freeloader, then just post that here. Then we will not be waiting for your 10%. This is OK, some people they are needing every last penny to survive, so you can explain why you must freeload while the others are contributing and working hard and you just keep all your precious VRC. maybe you are ashamed you are not wanting to admit this, but it is 10% of the VRC, not 90%, you can live without this 10%. Can you live with the shame of being a freeloader. Every day, you are reminded that you are the reason we are not achieving the goal.<br /><br />Now, if the community cannot do a simple thing like sending 10% to an escrow fund that unarguably will help the currency by a lot more than 10%, then how to expect becoming the fiat spokescurrency for all of SuperNET? I need to be able to show all the other coin communities the strong spirit of UNITY the VRC community has and if it cannot even do what is needed for itself, then this makes it difficult, even impossible for me to have much power to convince other coins.<br /><br />I expect that the trolls and even others are thinking this jl777 guy is clever, but he is just doing this for the making of more money. So, here is what I do to prove that I am no money motivated monkey.<br /><br />I, jl777, hereby donate 100% of all the escrowed funds that I might earn from my works with the VRC to the VRC community. These funds are to be used by community voting weighed by their VRC stake to determine approval or rejection of spending proposals. There will be two levels of threshold, simple majority and two-thirds majority, this it depends on what is being voted on. If a debate over what level threshold, then a simple majority vote will decide the threshold to use.<br /><br />I hope this proves that my goal and intent for the whole asking the impossible amount of money is not for personal gain, but for UNITY within VRC. Now, I might have some uses for some funds, so if ever the VRC community is feeling the sense of gratitude and thankfulness for whatever I am helping to achieve, then I will certainly not object to receiving a bounty from the escrow funds.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I do realize that I just gave away what will become worth more than $1 million USD, but this is less than half of what I have already given away, so it is not as &quot;big&quot; as it seems. I trust the VRC community to treat me properly when the time comes, but first I show the high level of trust to you.<br /></div><br />James. It seems to me you are lowering yourself to the Troll level you despise.<br /><br />Calling someone a &quot;Free Loader&quot; is your take/opinion and not condusive to the Harmony you say you Cherish.<br /><br />It&#039;s understated but it&#039;s still name calling.<br /><br />You&#039;d be given a warning &nbsp;if I was a Moderator<br /></div>How can I be namecalling somebody when I am mentioning no names? This is a logical error on your part. I am asking these people who are freeloading to declare this so as to enable the entire community to progress. Until there is all the 10% accounted for, there is no voting by the SuperNET to ratify the VRC role. The 10% it does not all have to go to the VRC fund, it just needs to be accounted for. How can anybody complain about this?<br /><br />If there is this person who is holding onto all his VRC and while everyone else is chipping in 10% and he probably has more than any 10 normal peoples, well what word will you use for this person? Maybe my english is broken again? What is the right word to describe this person? I care not the word used, but it should reflect the behavior so as to not confuse people.<br /><br />May I ask how much you have contributed? Sometimes, not always, the harshest critics of something are the ones that dont like what is proposed. I am not calling you a freeloader, just stating generalities.<br /><br />James</div>

He was always trying to trick me to reveal my voice or reveal my location, i hope he spent a lot of money to go to where I pretended to be.<br /><br />So, all the investors would have lost this 1 million NXT. Since he wouldnt do the right thing, I did. I swapped all the investors useless asset that encapsulated this real world known guys work with marketrate equiv JLH. The JLH has more than doubled since then so all the investors came out at least breakeven, most with nice profits.<br /><br />That is my identity. That is who I am. Somebody you can count on to do the right thing, always.<br /><br />Now I think you are part of this group that is trying to uncover my identity. you are bribing people with 10 BTC just for any info. since you were careful this time and did not slander you avoid the SHUN. But remember you are on warning, one more troll post and you will be shunned.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. This scammer said, &quot;you know who I am, what are you going to do sue me&quot;? </div>

This isnt the NXT community. So just asking who is holding my money, and wondering why its such a secret? What are you reasons to stay hidden?<br /><br />Its like my walking into a bank with a balaclava then acting confused when people think im doing something dodgy, then rufusing to take then mask off and claiming that im trustworthy<br /></div><br />Not a gut feeling. By the way, gut feelings help since all cognitive knowledge is integrated with affect regulation. But that&#039;s a side point.<br />It&#039;s pretty logical. Look at completed projects. Look at reputation. Look at self-interest.<br />I suppose it could all be some sort of long game to destroy crypto from within, or to take down the alts and restore Bitcoin&#039;s fortunes. Yeah, that&#039;s probably what&#039;s going on. Definitely.<br />Or maybe the simplest explanation is the best. Collaboration is productive. So is innovation. So is network effect. So is rewarding the people who work hard. And the best way to go about achieving that is... ?<br /><br /><br /></div>Here is my plan to take down bitcoin:<br /><br />Is not bitcoin a crypto? The crypto? <br />Of course the bitcoiners they are laughing at all the altcoins looking as snot kittens <a class="ul" href="https://nxtforum.org/index.php?topic=1437.msg96376#msg96376">https://nxtforum.org/index.php?topic=1437.msg96376#msg96376</a> so we must become one big SuperNET to be the size matching the bitcoin. Then we are easily to convince bitcoiners to also be UNITY as each coin is still active, thriving as part of SuperNET. It is only much easier to make the long distance phone call. So, once you are getting this ability to call anybody in the world with few buttons, then this is very hard to lose. <br /><br />I ask a question: How many people who are in the altcoins are never using the bitcoin?<br /><br />So, you see, there is no difference between the altcoin peoples and the bitcoin peoples, except for some small bitcoin only guys. They are maybe always in their own island, but this is OK. SuperNET is about choice. if they dont want to make the long distance calls, they never have to click the &quot;Enter Supernet&quot; button. The SuperNET it is only a way for everybody to connect. it is not some monster to eat a coin!<br /><br />So, the SuperNET it is just a copy of the internet for the websites, but the internet for the coins. A website joining the internet it is not losing anything, it only gains a global audience. A website that is running with no connection, this is the crypto without connection to the SuperNET.<br /><br />All coins, in fact any software will be able to connect to the SuperNET API and to all the other peoples connected to it. It is not needed to be inside the SuperNET core to be able to use the SuperNET.<br /><br />Now I hope you are understanding better the SuperNET. the bitcoin it is not separate, it is the coin every altcoiner is already using.<br /><br />James</div>

So, if everyone here will all just put on ignore the trolls on my ignorelist, then we can be totally immune to their attempts at manipulation. I will be proposing this in all my homes so we can conduct our lives without having to live with garbage all over the place.<br /><br />So, many are putting in the 10%, this is good, but it seems only 20% have put in the 10%, so there is still more to go. Let us not be greedy, let us all &quot;sacrifice&quot; 10%. I will put 100% of my VRC in. Now we cannot force everybody to put in 10%, but we know that 10% of the total is to the exact amount, so until it is reached this we are having freeloaders.<br /><br />Now if you are ok with being a freeloader, then just post that here. Then we will not be waiting for your 10%. This is OK, some people they are needing every last penny to survive, so you can explain why you must freeload while the others are contributing and working hard and you just keep all your precious VRC. maybe you are ashamed you are not wanting to admit this, but it is 10% of the VRC, not 90%, you can live without this 10%. Can you live with the shame of being a freeloader. Every day, you are reminded that you are the reason we are not achieving the goal.<br /><br />Now, if the community cannot do a simple thing like sending 10% to an escrow fund that unarguably will help the currency by a lot more than 10%, then how to expect becoming the fiat spokescurrency for all of SuperNET? I need to be able to show all the other coin communities the strong spirit of UNITY the VRC community has and if it cannot even do what is needed for itself, then this makes it difficult, even impossible for me to have much power to convince other coins.<br /><br />I expect that the trolls and even others are thinking this jl777 guy is clever, but he is just doing this for the making of more money. So, here is what I do to prove that I am no money motivated monkey.<br /><br />I, jl777, hereby donate 100% of all the escrowed funds that I might earn from my works with the VRC to the VRC community. These funds are to be used by community voting weighed by their VRC stake to determine approval or rejection of spending proposals. There will be two levels of threshold, simple majority and two-thirds majority, this it depends on what is being voted on. If a debate over what level threshold, then a simple majority vote will decide the threshold to use.<br /><br />I hope this proves that my goal and intent for the whole asking the impossible amount of money is not for personal gain, but for UNITY within VRC. Now, I might have some uses for some funds, so if ever the VRC community is feeling the sense of gratitude and thankfulness for whatever I am helping to achieve, then I will certainly not object to receiving a bounty from the escrow funds.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I do realize that I just gave away what will become worth more than $1 million USD, but this is less than half of what I have already given away, so it is not as &quot;big&quot; as it seems.

A developer that goes by the name &quot;james&quot; has been talking with the development team for a few weeks now about bring vericoin into a project he is working called SuperNET. From my basic understanding of the project it&#039;s basically like a blockchain 2.0 or a similar project to what the team on ethereum. Basically it&#039;s a newer more decentralized way of using digital currencies/blockchain technology. <br /><br />So it&#039;s not actually changing the coin, nor would this new developer actually be working on improving anything within vericoin - he is simply willing to make vericoin a part of his bigger project (which raised some 3,000 BTC yesterday in an IPO type launch). <br /><br />So as we speak we are on a short timeline to raise 500,000 VRC which is our upfront contribution to show him we are committed to having him work with our community. As of now we&#039;re at something like 475,000 VRC. So this vericoin that is being sent to a fund held by the developers will be paid over time when this guy is able to hit certain milestones in the price .0005 is the first watermark that has been talked about. <br /><br />If for any reason this project falls through, those who donated will get their money sent back. This is the fund: VECuyuNjLDh437hJfABSxV1817D982S4H6<br /></div>The SuperNET fund raising concept started weeks after my agreement with drkman. This deal is no guarantee of SuperNET core acceptance, VRC must earn that like any other coin. However, the spokescoin role, this is something that will be voted on by the SuperNET asset holders. We have 4 weeks to get VRC in its finest form so there is no controversy for passing this vote. So, the VRC, it is very special. Part of my cryto family that I am adopting, not as a baby like with BTCD, but as a fiesty teenager entering the prime of life. And soon a powerful voice for all of crypto in the mainstream fiat world. The funnel through which the forces of SuperNET will convert the ordinary fiat peoples into crypto peoples.<br /><br />I also think this function of reaching many peoples, there are many coins most notable the DOGE, which are very good at such things. I would like the VRC community to setup an outreach to all these like minded communities and we can join forces not only using technology, but just sharing the same UNITY. Maybe people are still not understanding that the most value in a coin is its community. The tech is of course needed, but without community there is nothing. A community without tech will be able to obtain the tech, all is required is some money. So please find the coin communities with already a good positive energy and we can create a combined megaphone to broadcast the UNITY message.<br /><br />All the coins will be able to use the SuperNET, even if they are not inside the core. Without these communities to use the SuperNET, then it is only internal traffics. this is not bad, but why not to make it 10x bigger?<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I like the odds of my new tech to achieve the acceptance in the new year.</div>
