I know not exactly TCP, I will probably do that some other day to add the connections concept, but Telepathy actually kind of does this...<br /><br />so, once there is a reliable way to transmit the withdraw packet, then DB MGW just calls that, signs around and submits. I cant promise to eat my hat if I dont get it done today, but I promise to think about eating my hat.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Still the BTCD did not arrive... :-/<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I found a bug!<br />I will send out manually in a few hours<br /><br />James

Since the AMtxid and cointxid is the signal that the withdraws were sent, that kind of makes sense.<br /><br />So, at long last DG mgwBTCD is caught up. It is a horribly inefficient process as it is as there are some reliability issues with the UDP packets, but that is on my list next to address. Also, you have to run the command one server at a time and the third server that got the broadcasts of the other two has all the data needed to verify consensus and get the signatures.<br /><br />I am just too tired to debug the bridge modes, so doing it all easy from a remote node is going to have to wait. But this data transfer reliability issue simply has to be fixed as it is causing bugs all throughout the system.<br /><br />James<br /><br />tldr: mgwBTCD is all caught up, plz post if you have a pending tx

The big question is the output capacity of LTCgear.

					I think I got 5 hrs sleep in the last 50, but finally I have the DB MGW generating a valid withdraw, achieving consensus on all three MGW servers, properly exchanging (though quite inefficient for now), signing around and getting a valid &quot;true&quot; status.<br /><br />After getting hit with a -22 error for using a spent output, at first I feared the DB was with bad data, but it was just due to some new code that I put in to improve things that totally broke the input selection. What I am doing now is including the smallest unspent into each withdraw. Since there is no additional cost to this, it will end up cleaning up one piece of dust at a time.<br /><br />Now that all the pieces are in place, I thought through the deployment and the horror of the production server guys reaction to being exposed to the flood of traffic on the main SuperNET. <br /><br />So I coded up a way to create a private supernet, which allows the usage of the SuperNET comms between the MGW servers and to be able to generate the deposit addresses offchain in near realtime, not to mention be able to get current status and even request to process pending deposit/withdraws.<br /><br />Great!<br /><br />Except, since they are on a separate private supernet, nobody will be able to communicate to them, realtime or no and would have to use the blockchain and I know how everybody loves waiting for their deposit addresses. Always seems a 10 minute block happens just when you are wanting the next block.<br /><br />OK, so just publish the location of the production servers (IP and port). Hmmm. Now more complaints from the production guys, they seem to be picky about stuff like that.<br /><br />So, I had to code up a way to bridge from the main SuperNET to the private supernet. Now any node can specify a bridgeipaddr/bridgeport and the MGW commands (later others) would be bridged to the private supernet. The return path is a bit klunky, but for now, just make another identical request to the bridge node and it will have&nbsp; local copy, so can immediately return it.<br /><br />How does this solve the issue of publishing the IP of the production servers? There does need to be a bridge node that everybody knows the location of, but it wont have to disclose the bridgeport. And firewalls on the MGW servers can be configured to only allow traffic from the bridge node.<br /><br />With this, everyone can get near realtime deposit addresses, etc, but the MGW servers are off in their own private supernet with only the bridgenode allowed access. This way we can put in filters and spam detection in the bridgenode before it even gets to the other side. Of course the bridgenode can be DDOS (actually bandwidth flood against UDP), but the blockchain can always be used to get a deposit address the old fashioned way (well I just checked I didnt do this yet, not sure if it will be needed).<br /><br />Now just have to debug it!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. part of the debugging will be to get the pending mgwBTCD withdraws processed. I have been processing the deposits as they come in

We are starting a SuperNET doxygen so the code will get documented, not sure how long it will take, but at least we are starting<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wasn't talking about the mgw but the mgwUI should be distributed with core. <br /><br />Is it possible for every NXT node to be an mgw node? If so, that would be great. I just don't see how... seeing how BTC stuff is base on 3xxxx addreses which require two of 3. Or, perhaps there is some way to have say an mgw mesh where as long as 3 servers of X agree then the withdrawal goes through... however, only 2 of the 3 servers that have the keys would need to be up and running to sign and do the transaction.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Oh, just the GUI. Of course, that would be quite easy. The SuperNET GUI is after all based on NXT GUI.<br />To make it provider agnostic, just need to have a form field for the selection of the asset/MGW hosts. Probably can make a macro like setup, so the user just has to select the asset id and it would automatically know which MGW hosts are for that assset id.<br /><br />Once BTC's multisig with up to 16 signers propagates, we could distribute the deposits in slices to different randomly selected peers. The danger is an attacker could make a bunch of nodes and well that would be various levels of bad depending on how many nodes they can control<br /><br />So, we would probably want to limit node selection to accounts that are in your contact list that you mark as ok for MGW hosting, but no way to actually make sure they run as MGW host, so the tech is possible, but the reality is that it is not easy to find viable hosts.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, yes, that's the weekness with the mgw. There has to be some trust. We have to trust:<br /><br />1. The keyholder of the NXT account holding the non-backed mgw assets<br />2. The 3 servers that hold the multisig keys for the backing coin.<br /><br />I think the biggest issue with the mgw at this time is the fact they aren't always all up at the same time. If we trust the mgw server operators, would it make sense to move to a single key system where each mgw server operator has the PKs? I think the main risk here would be the hacking of a server where the attacker could get the key. In this case, I think the system should build in a cold wallet solution where a high percentage of money is moved to a cold wallet, with a 3 key address, and it would take 2 of the 3 operators to fund the hot wallet from the cold wallet if it ran low of the backing currency.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I split out the asset handling so a fourth node can deal with all the assets. Once Phasing is here, this &quot;fourth&quot; node can be MofN among many different nodes.<br /><br />The DB MGW solves most of the uptime issues. Right now all three need to be in perfect lockstep all the time. With the DB MGW, it changes a bit so it can be an on-demand service. What that means is that you should be able to calculate the withdraws that need to be done as of a specific block number. And this subtle changes means that as long as the three servers are up at some point in time, the withdraws can be calculated and saved, then shared with the other servers.<br /><br />Still need to wait for coin confirmations, but I envision a setup where the user can make a request to process a withdraw that has the required confirmations. And this will get queued and handled as soon as three servers have run after this point in time.<br /><br />James<br /><br />tl:dr MGW is about to become much more practical.

We are starting a SuperNET doxygen so the code will get documented, not sure how long it will take, but at least we are starting<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wasn't talking about the mgw but the mgwUI should be distributed with core. <br /><br />Is it possible for every NXT node to be an mgw node? If so, that would be great. I just don't see how... seeing how BTC stuff is base on 3xxxx addreses which require two of 3. Or, perhaps there is some way to have say an mgw mesh where as long as 3 servers of X agree then the withdrawal goes through... however, only 2 of the 3 servers that have the keys would need to be up and running to sign and do the transaction.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Oh, just the GUI. Of course, that would be quite easy. The SuperNET GUI is after all based on NXT GUI.<br />To make it provider agnostic, just need to have a form field for the selection of the asset/MGW hosts. Probably can make a macro like setup, so the user just has to select the asset id and it would automatically know which MGW hosts are for that assset id.<br /><br />Once BTC's multisig with up to 16 signers propagates, we could distribute the deposits in slices to different randomly selected peers. The danger is an attacker could make a bunch of nodes and well that would be various levels of bad depending on how many nodes they can control<br /><br />So, we would probably want to limit node selection to accounts that are in your contact list that you mark as ok for MGW hosting, but no way to actually make sure they run as MGW host, so the tech is possible, but the reality is that it is not easy to find viable hosts.<br /><br />James

I see that you're mentioning people that are running multiple BTC nodes with multisig, that's not decentrailzation of an exchange software, it's a fail-over solution.<br />They are all running soft written by jl777 and I doubt they check the code after every patch for what it actually does (if ever). <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Many of us are running software created by Jean-Luc and Gavin Anderson without checking every patch. I don't see how that makes it less decentralized. The software is open source, so anyone is free to check it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/price-speculation/msg140129/#msg140129">Quote from: dude on December 13, 2014, 06:53:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">And as I pointed out in the other thread, the control of NXT account that owns all mgwBTC is decentralized how? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>An acknowledged problem which will be solved when phasing is added to Nxt.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/price-speculation/msg140129/#msg140129">Quote from: dude on December 13, 2014, 06:53:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Just don't market this software as decentralized exchange because it is simply not, sadly people believe you without actually checking how it works.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I agree it's not a decentralized exchange. It's kind of complicated to describe, and because it's not centralized, people have called it decentralized without realizing that's not the best way to describe it. But that doesn't mean it's: &quot;run by one anonymous person.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think distributed is most accurate. <br />With DB MGW, any three people can setup an MGW with a few API calls (and time to generate initial DB), now whether other people will trust the assets these people issue, this is a separate question.<br /><br />One possibility would be to have the ability for any DB MGW trio to process withdraws that they have the unspent funds for and if everyone used the same assets, it would be fungible. However, what this would do is make it so if any triplet is evil, it will drain funds from the system. Now if things are decentralized enough, this might be an acceptable risk, especially if the MofN is increased a lot.<br /><br />The code is able to handle MoN values larger than 2of3, but the logistics of finding 3 production server hosts has been hard enough.<br /><br />MGW isnt perfect. But like in the bear joke, it doesnt have to outrun the bear, just needs to outrun the other peoples. As far as being distributed and being realtime transparent, I think it is fair to say that MGW is significantly ahead of the other exchanges.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I have decoupled deposit processing, so any node can do the asset holding and deposit transfer. When Phasing arrives, this duty can be distributed to however many people that is desired. MGW is a tool that the community can build with.

Complains of delays in receiving BTC have been going on for last couple of months.<br /><br />I would like to request jl777 to assign very high priority to MGWBTC, <br /><br />1- Transactions should be faster.<br />2- There should be enough BTC and NXT in the wallets to cover at least 50 BTC daily volume<br /><br />imho, if NXT is still going to rely on BTER then nobody is going to take us seriously.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Most of the complaints of delays were due to the dev MGW servers being used much longer than planned. We have transitioned to the production servers, but during the transition, I still had to keep running the dev servers... So this made the delays still exist. I really cannot be expected to be watching all three MGW servers 24 hours per day, can I?<br /><br />Now with the 3 production servers, we are seeing downtimes due to this or that on one server or the other. The requirement of all three servers to be in sync, requires all three to be in sync. So if any is not in sync, it stops. I think as we find the issues to watch for (stuck coin blockchains, etc.) that automated scripts can be created to detect and alert, but this is really not for me to do.<br /><br />I have spent 2 weeks totally rewriting the MGW to become database oriented, similar to the recent change in NXT to go to a DB format. This will allow for a fourth (or even fifth) server to process deposits and for withdraws to be requested on demand. We still need to wait for the confirmations, but I think going to an on-demand service will be a good improvement.<br /><br />I already have near realtime deposit address generation. ~5 minute time to calculate and process deposits, but there need to be the coin confirmations. But the withdraws will still need the syncing of all three and the NXT confirmations. Still it should be a much more responsive setup. You cannot get realtime deposit/withdraw processing without also getting exposed to all sorts of attack vectors that I dont even begin to comprehend. Wait the confirmations and these attack vectors go away. So, I choose to wait, rather than push things to get to realtime and expose all the funds to risk.<br /><br />As far as having enough funds on hand, your first point does not make sense. MGW operates with 100% reserves, so there is no limit as to the amount it can handle. Ah, the problem you talk about is probably just due to this transition period, there is still about 100 BTC left on the dev servers and a withdraw on the production servers would need to get the funds from the devservers, so there is double the time.<br /><br />I am giving very high priority to MGW, things are being improved to reduce the delays and increase reliability, it still wont be realtime unless we can find volunteers to manually process all withdraws 24/7. You have to remember, nobody is making any money from running the MGW.<br /><br />James
