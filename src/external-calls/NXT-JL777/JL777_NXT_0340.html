It took a few Google searches and reading online forums.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That nicely applies to Ripple as well. Their site is very business-oriented with all those buzzwords (learn/trade/integrate, and it sounds like integrate WITH US) and there's no link to the client on the front page. I've googled a bit and found one written in JS that requires manual building. They also <a href="https://ripple.com/knowledge_center/downloadable-client-account-setup-and-login/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">don't support it anymore</a> which is very suspicious. Instead of a binary they <a href="https://ripple.com/client/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">suggest</a> using <a href="https://rippletrade.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">their web wallet</a>. It has a scary red warning as a welcome that's also written in Japanese and Korean and <em>very closely</em> reminds me of Mt. Gox... in a bad sense. Do you want to trade on such a platform that doesn't even belong to you and can shutdown any moment? Neither do I.<br /><br />So, what do we have in the end? A seemingly nice, previously open and freedom-loving company that has gone fully centralized, SaaS'ed everything and started making $$$. I expect the same from MaidSafe and StorJ, too many bells have rung already. The only question I have is what does Ripple have to do with cryptocurrencies at all and NXT in particular? It's just another SaaS startup that has some scam traits from my perspective. While NXT is a true technological marvel that continues to grow and evolve staying FOSS in all respects.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>ripple has 5 different validator nodes<br />all ripple nodes<br />

NXT is worth 1 billion NXT, and XORA is worth 1 billion NXT. That extra billion of wealth *could* solve a lot of funding problems for NXT.<br /><br />BUT, it's obviously very difficult to get that level of unambiguous community support, and it would be seen as very 'controversial' by many people. We all know the typical criticism of the NXT distribution and the 73 IPO people. But that was BCNext's prerogative as the creator of NXT! <br /><br />Imagine the response to XORA? A relatively obscure crypto project decides to create a billion XORA MS coins out of thin air to create the 'defacto shuffle' coin for the whole of NXT, and then pegs them to 1 NXT each, making some people very wealthy overnight! Despite being a GREAT idea (good for the shuffle idea, possible ongoing funding source for NXT) it's obviously going to be very difficult to 'sell' to the wider crypto community, especially if we don't even have strong majority support at home amongst average NXT'ers.<br /><br />The outcome if we keep XORA with the 1:1, but we eventually FAIL to get overwhelming support is ORA would be dead, BUT, NXT itself would be unharmed. That's OK IMO, we would have tried for the best outcome and failed.<br /><br />The outcome if we keep XORA with the 1:1, and we SUCCEED, and we do get overwhelming support for keeping XORA is ORA becomes a beautiful 'starfish' in the NXT ecosystem, and NXT has great anonymous features through shuffling, AND, NXT has another source of community funding. That's awesome!!<br /><br />The outcome if we re-issue without the 1:1 limitation is we keep working on ORA, and we still have a shot at making the new ORA MS currency the default shuffle coin over time. That's pretty OK too!<br /><br />Everything obviously hinges on getting <strong>massive community wide support</strong> for keeping XORA, and hopefully it'll be really obvious if we achieve that, so we don't keep XORA and fail. <br /><br />IMO it's very unlikely we will get massive unambuguous support (e.g. Berlin Wall 1989, Arab Spring, Beatlemania etc), but it's still well worth the attempt!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>any pegging would be an illusion due to the following simple mechanism.<br /><br />Alice has 166,000 XORA, Bob says I will pay $100 for it. Alice agrees and they swap<br />this cannot be stopped.<br /><br />so if you &quot;peg&quot; it significantly above market price, them all liquidity of whatever is pegging it will be exhausted (see soros vs England) and then it will trade at its market price (with big spreads and lack of liquidity)<br /><br />

					as you can see from above price decimals is not an issue, there is no need to reissue. Just trade 100+ XORA at a time<br /><br />Can someone verify that transferCurrency call works with XORA?

I haven&#039;t tried it yet or fully understand how it works, but it seems that the dev has bots on IRC to do the mixing and currently looking for a P2P method of doing Bitcoin Mixing. <br /><br />I was looking into mixing as I buy my coins from coinbase and I find it annoying that my coins are being tracked where they go. I don&#039;t do anything crazy with them, but I do sell them from time to time to friends. It&#039;s just that what if I one day sold it to a friend that sold it to another friend that was involved in illegal activity like terrorist stuff. Guess who they are going to trace those coins back to in order to find that guy? It just something I don&#039;t&nbsp; want to stress over and worry about. <br /><br />I think if NXT can somehow develop a plugin to mix Bitcoins, it would drive alot of people coming to the NXT platform just to mix their coins for privacy. <br /><br />Thoughts?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>exactly!<br />

The Asset::XORA price would always be 1:1 but the asset could be bought/sold for less than 1 NXT that way.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting idea! What would give the Asset::XORA value? I'm always open to consider every suggestion, so thanks for making it <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We could back it with the treasury account.... or the account that issues the XORACommon. So basically the MS would be the &quot;Prefered&quot; stock and the Asset would be the &quot;common stock&quot;.<br /><br />The account would issue the asset with the same population as Ora. <br /><br />The only thing I'm not sure of, is it possible to exchange an Asset for an MS on the exchange? I expect not so we would have to set up some way to do it, sort of like the MGW... you send XORA currency to the account and it sends you XORAAsset and vice versa. We would just have to find some way to cover the tx fees. Perhaps we charge a small fee to do the exchange.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>MScoins are basically assets (assuming the transferCurrency API is not disabled due to issuance options)<br />InstantDEX will support MScoins<br />InstantDEX will allow asset &lt;-&gt; MScoin or MScoin &lt;-&gt; NXT<br /><br />As far as precision, cant get any arbitrary price, but I am doing a small brute force search of nearby price/volume combos to get as close to the price as possible. Trade bundles of 100+ XORA and you can get 1 digit precision, 1000+ XORA and 2 digits, etc.<br /><br />the reason is due to the property of integer ratios, ie A/B, (A+1)/B, A/(B+1) these all change the price, substitute the &quot;1&quot; with bigger numbers to get larger search range, but the most important is the relative starting ratio of A and B<br /><br />So if A is 3 and B is 2, we have a price of 1.5<br /><br />you want 1.75? then it would be 7 of A and 4 of B. See, we get decimals even though we cant with just 1 XORA<br /><br />And when the A and B are determined for the two things, an atomic swap using transferAsset, transferCurrency is used<br /><br />James<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HX3Ohj2.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />

If it is displayed on the screen, a high res video can be taken. if audio, just record it.<br /><br />RIAA tried to stop music piracy. MPAA is trying to stop video piracy. Centralized, heavy handed and still doesnt work<br /><br />Answer is not tech, but to provide something more than just the raw bits. maybe interviews with the artist, or something as simple as a regular newsletter, membership in fanclub site, etc.<br /><br />James

To be afraid that somebody else will start selling your products and to not sell it in the first place, then it is not being sold at all. I think the answer is not technological. You need to have something more than just the raw bits, something a pirate cant copy. <br /><br />you basically want to do something that really cant be done even with a centralized setup, as somebody could buy on amazon and then sell on eBay using a different language, how would you even know about the pirated copies in kazakstan?
