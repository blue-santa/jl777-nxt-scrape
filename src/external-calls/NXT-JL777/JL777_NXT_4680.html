Granted at first it was skewed toward the lucky 73, but as combined asset values dwarves the 1 billion NXT, the disproportionate amount the 73 got will continue to get diluted if they just hold. Now the ones that allocate their funds wisely will be able to maintain their &quot;lucky&quot; windfall percentage, but if they can do that, they arent just lucky, they are smart investors.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Saying the first 73 adopters were lucky is denying the efforts they made and risks they took. Sure they invested a small amount of money compared to the profits they made. But so it is with all investments in startup. The problem is that very few startups succeed, and there are way more failures, you can't just invest in them all, it requires a lot of work and spreading of risk to hit that one jackpot. Saying that a certain entrepreneur or investor was lucky is something you can't know. They might if they just threw a dart but more likely most of them have put a lot more into it. <br /><br />Also your reasoning about people's nxt being diluted because companies are growing expressed in nxt value is incorrect. The value of assets in an economy is always much bigger than the amount of money in circulation. It is possible that in booms people overvalue assets, which lowers the purchasing power of the money, but this will always reverse sooner or later and the money gains back it's purchasing power. Only money printing can create a permanent loss of purchasing power, and nxt is the best on that front as there is zero inflation. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I dont know about you, but I have talked with several of the full BTC investors and they pretty much feel that they did get a lot more than was reasonably expected considering the amount invested and time elapsed. But they all felt a duty to give back to the community, definitely not the standard investor gets ROI by making shrewd investments.<br /><br />So you are saying that in a scenario where 73 people are given all the USD in the world and magically there is only 1 billion USD ever, that these 73 as a group have more financial power than a billgates that ends up with 50 billion USD worth of marketcap? To a simple guy like me, it just seems that billgates with 50 billion of MSFT stock has about 50 times the economic power of the 73 who started with all the USD. This is what I mean when I say that the larger the combined asset values become, the less significant the windfall billion NXT the 73 got.<br /><br />You seem to be so much smarter than me, so lets just agree to disagree as you do not seem to be understanding what I am saying and repeating things usually doesnt help<br /><br />James

Oil states are settling oil not in USD, but gold and anything but USD.<br />With the 40% boost USD gets from being the global settlement currency effectively gutted, and the &quot;revenues&quot; (aka taxes) insufficient to even pay just the interest on all the debt sometime this year or next, there seems to be only two possible solutions:<br />a) massive inflation some Friday late afternoon before a long weekend, something like 50% so all prior debts are effectively cut in half<br />b) selling off the vast real estate, like Grand Canyon to Disney, etc.<br /><br />I guess a third option is to punt and let the market do the dirty work, but that would be most messy<br /><br />James

Now the ones that allocate their funds wisely will be able to maintain their &quot;lucky&quot; windfall percentage, but if they can do that, they arent just lucky, they are smart investors.<br /><br />Now that external companies are seeing the potential of NXT AE and the speed at which things can happen, there is no stopping the flood of new assets. Of course, not all assets are good assets, but the market is doing a pretty good job so far without much guidance or help from their govts. There are many services being developed to help people properly analyze the assets. No govts to tell you what you are able to buy or not buy. Gee, we have to think for ourselves. This might be &quot;unfair&quot; for people who are not used to having everything spoon fed to them, but a meritocracy requires merit, eg. intelligence, effort, etc. This is why I do not think NXT is for everybody, just 1% of global economy will do just fine.<br /><br />James

					I finally got my test MGW servers caught up and updated. so all the pending multisig address generation requests should have been fulfilled. better late than never! MGW &quot;database&quot; lives on all the various blockchains so it cant be deleted.<br /><br />I will be running some withdraw tests to make sure I didnt break it. the production server guys are working on getting MGW running reliably and securely, so many progressings in parallel.<br /><br />It seems like it is taking ~15 minutes to restart MGW, which is not great, but once it is reliable it should rarely need restarts, so I think it is acceptable for now.<br /><br />While I wait for the withdraws to get confirmed, I will revisit the strange win32 bit dividend problem.

At first very confusing, so just ask if you have any questions. Many helpful people here and best ideas tend to float to the top and just start getting implemented.<br /><br />James

If that was accurate, then you need to control 475 million NXT to control the forging.<br /><br />With NXT ownership fragmented into 1% to 5% chunks, it will be very difficult for any coalition to get more than 10% to 15% and all that work to get several thousand NXT per day? At the risk of destroying the market value?<br /><br />So, it would only make sense for a hostile entity who wants to harm NXT to do this. Since 25 million NXT influx over several days doubled the price. My estimate of 10x the price for a 100 million NXT accumulation is probably pretty close. 475 million NXT??? With only ~250 million to 350 million NXT even available for sale at any price less than $1, it will cost the financial attacker something on the order of billion USD, to pull off.<br /><br />Oh, they better hurry cuz by the end of the year, they would need to get 900 million NXT once Transparent Forging is fully implemented. NXT is still vulnerable to a fiat govt or large multinational bank spending a billion USD to buy up and control it. I dont lose any sleep over this.<br /><br />James

Of course once &quot;jl777hodl&quot; has something missing it is no longer &quot;jl777hodl&quot;.

It would enable all sorts of types of markets and let the markets run very efficiently through arbitrage. It also creates more transactions for the network which of course is positive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I didnt think of that! Yes, very cool if a bundled asset could be &quot;redeemed&quot; and converted to its components. Then it would never trade much below its breakup value.<br /><br />Not sure how hard this will be to implement, but other than specifying how to allocate non-divisible fractions, it does not seem to be too tricky. The problem is for assets that dont have enough decimals, you would need to round and that causes big problems if it has to add up precisely because it is not possible in most cases.<br /><br />I will ask kushti when he gets back if he can do this. Would be a very nice tx type to have!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Dunster, you are new here! Welcome to NXT. I like how you think, maybe you want to check out the TEAM projects?

Of course there should be perpetual assets. But short lived assets can be offered at a cheaper fee.</li><li>Asset Bundles - Assets that can be bundled together and sold in groups as well as those assets being able to be traded individually would be very useful.</li></ul>These two properties would enable a number of new types of markets. However, they may never work if assets have high fees. Perpetual assets can have a high fee but if non-perpetual assets can have a low fees (for short lives) this would help getting more transactions running on the network.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>expiring or callable assets would be great!<br /><br />you can already create an asset bundle. jl777hodl is an example. It would be nice if the blockchain would enforce a restriction for not allowing transfers out of a bundle though. As it is people have to trust that i wont remove assets from jl777hodl. Of course I wont, but still it is a trust point that would be nice to eliminate. Market price trades would be the only way to remove existing holding from a bundled asset. No restrictions for adding new things to the bundle.<br /><br />James

A lot of people conclude that if anybody has a lot of money they are probably evil and dont deserve it and should give all of it away. anyway at 6 cents I am a USD 500 thousandaire. When I worked for big corps, I was earning $100/hr, so this is a bit more than a years earnings with the hours I work, so it is not so out of proportion to the risk I took.<br /><br />I believe that the NXT dream is for anybody who is hard working can actually become a USD millionaire. No need to just have been lucky at the beginning, NXT allows everybody the chance to become financial success. <br /><br />do you think all millionaires are evil and dont deserve it?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not at all James, you read me wrong on this one. I was thinking more like, 'Wow, well done mate'. And thanks for for letting us know how you achieved it. It's motivating for some of us 'sardines' who aspire to greater things. I was relatively late into crypto so it's great to see how other people have climbed the ladder.<br /><br />In terms of wanting to know how many other big NXT holdings there are, it's only natural to want to know a bit about distribution.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There were 8 full BTC investors that each got 50 million NXT. The rest of 73 got mostly much smaller amounts. I cant say for sure, but I believe half a dozen of the original 8 (I am not sure who the other two are) have given away or sold off half or more of their 50 million along the way. It is simply a very hard thing to not cash out hundreds of thousands of dollars of profits! The smaller holders have most likely sold an even larger percentage on average than the half dozen. There are probably a couple dozen early adopters who purchased 10 to 50 million NXT on the open market. I would say less than 50 of the original 73 and early adopters who got it at 1 BTC per million NXT (!!) still have more than 10 million NXT. probably less than half a dozen still have 50 million and most of those would be the early adopters and not the original founders. So roughly 25 USD millionaires at current 6 cent prices would be my guesstimate. Most of these are down to their long term core holdings and most likely wont sell at any price, short of $1, cuz they already have all the fiat they need. Whats the rush, especially now that NXT is where it is? This means the active liquid NXT is probably around 250 million total, which is still plenty especially with the normal trading volumes of 1 million NXT per day. The deck has already been shuffled, I dont believe there is any organized coalition that can come up with more than 10% to 15% of all NXT. If you know people, you will know how hard it is to get any half dozen to agree on anything! I dont believe any other crypto has this level of dispersion. OK, NEM is fantastically dispersed, but it is not yet and dispersion is not what creates a great crypto. Concentration in few hands, like the three mining pools that have 66%+ of bitcoin, or the instamines for most alts, really make PoW coins insecure. So, while NXT isnt perfect, it is certainly better than PoW simply due to the fact that someone needs to control the majority of market cap(!) not just majority of current mining power. Even DOGE with decent market cap will be able to be attacked very soon and who does this attacking? The bitcoin miners! Yes, it seems they feel a duty to cram the bitcoin blockchain down all sha256 coins and that sure becomes the longest chain real fast. A big laugher for the bitcoin guys and a totally ruined coin for the alt.<br /><br />Well I have proven that i am no genius, I just work really hard. At first, I was totally lost with this crypto thing, gee that was 6 months ago. Then with NXT being Java and me only knowing C, I started just doing tech support on the main BTT thread.<br /><br />I started out with 2 bitcoins that I had a hard time getting. Finally had to by it via localbitcoins and paying $100 premium. That seemed wrong! I stumbled into Ripple and at the time (not knowing any better) it seemed like a big improvement over BTC. Actually, it probably is but it has a fatal flaw. The community there is half a dozen guys and a bunch of corporate forum moderators who dont tolerate anything anti-ripple. just mentioning NXT got me reprimanded. Seeing the huge spreads, low liquidity, buggy software and corporatization I predicted ripple would not last long, or at least it would fizzle.<br /><br />I had sold off my real world assets to get $20K of crypto and by the time I figured out no alt was worth having I put it all into NXT. I had about 600K NXT. Then the whole peercover disaster got me. They lost 150000 NXT during their development of their NXT gateway into ripple and they would have had a hard time surviving if they had to cover it. So I sent them 25% of my total NXT to cover there losses. When it finally came online, it was rejected by most of NXT community, even though it was a viable path to fiat 6 months ago.<br /><br />One of the big problems of ripple is that they have two major USD gateways, bitstamp and snapswap with peercover a third. The values were often 20%+ different. With the rippling automatically siphoning off the good bitstamp USD into the snapswap that was worth 20% less, it was a big problem. I had managed to make trading gains to overcome the 20% discount, but it took some luck and several good trades to pull out $25K from ripple into normal BTC and then NXT!<br /><br />So, I started doing some USD conversion service at a 5% fee. Sounds crazy to charge people 5% for changing USd to USD, but people were clamoring for it and within minutes of the funds being available, it was all gone. So, &quot;riskless&quot; 5% was nice, but I had to pull it out of snapswap and send it to bitstamp. Then I had the idea of bypassung this and going from snapswap to peercover USD, maybe even make another few percent. Pretty clever huh? Well, it was fine until peercover got hit by bank fraud exactly the moment ~$10000 of my funds were going through. Poof! all gone. So, enough was enough. I had lost 150000 NXT and now $10000.<br /><br />Along the way I became the largest WCG miner with a serverfarm I put together using borrowed funds. I was a bit late starting so I didnt get all the easy money, but for a couple of months it was more than paying the bills. So, added more and more servers on credit until I had over 180! On good days clearing $1 or even $2 per server. Soon I would recoup all that was lost, except the mining difficulty kept rising and rising and by end of Feb it was barely breakeven. then ripple announces they are cancelling the WCG program in 30 days. Ooops. I was on month to month, but I couldnt quite ramp things down in time, so profits became losses. Then XRP started to go from 25 XRP per USD to 30,to 40, to 50, ... <br /><br />I figured it would bounce back so stupidly didnt convert the XRP, figuring after a ripple announcement of a big business deal, it would snap back, at least some. I had to recoup $70000 to breakeven from the stockpiled XRP. All I needed was it to get back to half its peak value. Well, instead of a happy announcement, we got the Jed announcement that he was going to sell 150% of the total market supply in two weeks. So instead of $70000, I was lucky to escape with $7000. And that took some quick trading to double what it would have been.<br /><br />Looking at all that happened, it is quite surprising that I am where I am today!<br /><br />Ah, there were three things I did right. I burned a dozen BTC for XCP and purchased and mined DRK in early Feb. So all the horribleness of the ripple based fiasco was erased with the recent DRK explosion in price. My 50000 DRK went from being worth $10000 to $500000! Actually it wasnt that good, as I kept selling off half each time it doubled after I was able to clear my bills. I was too busy to figure out how to get my XCP to an exchange and sell off half when it would have got me 150 BTC, but still I was able to clear something like 400 BTC.<br /><br />The third thing I did right? Oh, work 80+ hours per week on NXT and started programming in late Feb. programming has always been my fallback, so the same week DRK pulled me out of debt and got me hundreds of BTC, it was only the second biggest thing. NXT AE had created a market cap of some mind boggling amount. I only sold to private investors and just small amounts on the open market. Most all the volumes of my assets are from the early investors and people who purchased on AE. <br /><br />I strongly feel that NXT is going to get a lot bigger in the future. I have had this feeling from the moment I found out about it last christmas. Assuming that this is the case, then I conclude that NXT based businesses, especially automated ones will act as leveraged NXT. The critical element is for the business to scale with the NXT user base and NXT market cap. That is why I concentrated on financial and tech assets. The financial ones are no-brainer. As NXT marketcap grows, NXTventure will be able to finance larger and larger enterprises and its dividends will scale with NXT. The automated tech companies also will scale almost linearly, but at the high ends of NXT valuations it will not be able to keep up. However, if there is a large external market that it can cannibalize (like all centralized exchanges), its initial growth path will be much faster than NXT can possibly grow.<br /><br />People say I am doing too many things. maybe I am, but I think this is better than not doing enough things, or not doing anything like some of my critics who are quick to criticize me but I dont see anything they are doing. <br /><br />I would like to publicly thank aldrin for his generous support of my ideas and his critical donation to me during the darkest times. He just granted me a big chunk of NXT so I didnt have to worry about money. It was a lot more than anybody ever just gave to me before I did a project and with all my expenses covered for the rest of the year I was able to really concentrate on NXTservices instead of wasting time with bill collectors, finding rent money, etc.<br /><br />Without aldrin I would have been forced to hire myself out as contractor just to pay back debt and bills (I didnt know about DRK going 50x yet). then most likely my NXT work would have been reduced dramatically.<br /><br />All the TEAM members who now have about one third of what I originally had can also thank aldrin's generosity. I have worked very hard toward a bounty, only to have it suddenly taken away without any notice or conversation. This is not conducive to getting the best talent working hard. I have created a pretty ambitious vision of assets companies and while given time I could probably do most of it myself, I realized aldrin's wisdom. The more people that become vested in NXT, the better for NXT. So I did my usual too much thing and did too much recruiting <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />So, now I have gone from 2 BTC in hand to coordinating a TEAM of nearly thirty people, one third ownership of half a dozen operating asset companies with a market value of nearly 100 million NXT, in 6 months. I have made many mistakes and I will continue to make mistakes, but I am used to working extra hard to make up for them. I think it is easy for people to say that I became rich too easy, but the above leaves out many other battles I have had behind the scenes. It really wasnt as easy as it sounds.<br /><br />What is most amazing to me about the NXT community is that the vast majority of people here are good people and are really helping each other as best as they can. The emules and fudster types are few and far between. I think the recent acrimony was due to the big money lost (not made) that put people on edge. I am just one small part of NXT. We just need to do what we can to help each other succeed and NXT is truly unstoppable. Just know this will be a several year marathon to complete the first stage and before the second stage will start.<br /><br />James

					I found a memory leak which could have caused the memory leaking until it consumed all memory for the version I rushed out the door before my week off.<br /><br />Still waiting for the bitcoind to reindex, but hopefully the production server guys can verify it is stable.<br />I also put in an improvement that boosts the number of withdrawals up significantly from 100/day<br />at least I think it should. Even 100 withdraws per day would be sufficient until we hit pretty high volumes, but I know I hate to wait anymore than I have to.<br /><br />Not sure of the throughput, but I think it is possible to get 1000+ withdraws per day<br />I think i fixed the dividend calc bug (seems to be a MS compiler bug!) so if the MGW server is stable, I can make a new v07 NXTservices that uses the production servers. Still testnet, but at least the servers wont die if my local ISP drops my internet connection and I lose ssh (happens daily it seems)<br /><br />James
