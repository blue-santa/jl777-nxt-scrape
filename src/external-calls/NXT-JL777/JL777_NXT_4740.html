Once NXT gets direct fiat gateways, there isnt any point to go through ripple, especially with all the uncertainity.<br /><br />My prediction is that RL will have to pay a big chunk of their capital to prevent XRP collapse and that will lead to layoffs due to high burn rate. just doesnt look good at all for RL.

					Back home, so I will be able to be online all the time again.<br /><br />Seems like I missed a crazy week. Even after the pullback, NXT is still up significantly from before I left. Due to sharkfund0 having ~30% not in NXT, the overall value in NXT has dropped below 10000 NXT <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br />However, it has gained significantly in BTC terms and even more in fiat terms. <br /><br />The fund started with around 1400 BTC capital, now it is ~1800 BTC for a 28% gain<br />In fiat terms the fund started at around $800K and now it is $1167K for a 45% gain<br /><br />I aim to get back to 10000 NXT per sharkfund0 by more actively managing the NXT balance. Another idea I had was to actively make a market in NXT on the exchanges. The gain would be incremental, but it would stabilize the market price. This big rollercoaster is very stressful and I prefer a more gradual change in prices<br /><br />Anyway, I repriced the sharkfund0 to 9000/9100 NXT<br /><br />The DRK/NXT ratio is getting close to 100:1, which I think is a critical floor. Since I sold at &gt;250:1, even the current 140:1 is a good gain. All that is needed is a bit of a NXT bump and DRK drop and the 100:1 will be hit. I am seeing peercoin trading opposite of NXT, so it looks like money is being circulated between PPC, DRK and NXT. <br /><br />James<br />

This is the reason James is neither advertising it nor promising anything about that.<br /><br />I see it more as value keeper. Well I would pay 10 times more as I see it right now. So james receives 10 times more NXT as he has put into this asset. He will save this assets for a long time, maybe in the future when they are worth much more he will start investing again with this and share dividends. At this point of time this might be a huge oppurtinity. But well, I have not seen anyone advertising for jl777hodl, therefore I would not recommend it myself.<br />It is just an oppurtunity that is cheap to get (speaking in current rates)<br /><br />Maybe in some years nobody will speak of james anymore and so on... but he is doing good in making nxt with his assets. And I do support him as he is working now<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I do not plan to be advertising my various assets<br />The information is there for intelligent investors to calculate and evaluate whether it is a good value or not<br /><br /><a href="http://nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-2AHU-UXZW-K9Q2-HENLW&amp;c=USD" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-2AHU-UXZW-K9Q2-HENLW&amp;c=USD</a><br />The above is a handy way to check the market value of jl777hodl, it is showing 1.04 NXT per asset, so current prices that are below .9 are at a discount. This is valuing the Boost, NXTsharks and NXTforex assets at 0<br /><br />The assets in jl777hodl will stay there long term or be converted to NXT. So, while I cannot promise what will be added to jl777hodl, you can know that the current holdings will stay there or be sold off for NXT<br /><br />James

I thought you were an honorable guy, not a name caller<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I'm sorry you feel offended. I wasn't refering to you about the insider trading but to some I have seen making a fortune in the bitcoin world. On top of selling loads of shares for btc, they would use their insider knowledge as CEO to buy or sell stock at the expense of their investors. I can see how it looked I was insinuating you do this too. I'm sorry. I don't think that. I have no opinion on that. <br /><br />I do see that you are getting a lot of nxt from investors, and I think that you will very likely not be able to grow those nxt into more nxt. <br /><br />I haven't followed your assets in detail but for example Graviton is clearly such a sharp entrepreneur. I think he got 20 million nxt or something by selling 30% of his company. This 20 million nxt is not for the company but for him. It is extremely likely that those investors will never see those nxt back because of their shares tanking in nxt value the moment nxt goes up. <br /><br />Are your assets the same structure? The nxt you get in return for the shares, do they become yours (company structure), or are they owned by the asset (fund structure)?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I did not do IPO for my assets (InstantDEX, NXTcoinsco, NXTventure)<br />I sold privately to a small number of investors and all funds were put into the asset itself. I did not personally get the NXT from the investors.<br />I did put relatively small amounts for sale on AE and all proceeds went back into the asset.<br />Since the operating companies currently dont have much cash expenses, I consolidated the NXT in the assets mostly into sharkfund0, again I am not personally getting the NXT. <br /><br />I have been very careful to segregate my personal trading from the company tradings. A few times I made mistakes thinking I was in one acct and not the other, but I made corrections and I also do any asset exchanging at then current market prices<br /><br />You are welcome to analyze the activity of any of my assets.<br /><br />The bulk of my personal NXT gains came from my DRK and XCP investments, which netted me over 400 BTC, plus I had sold all my other assets to buy NXT and worked hard to get bounties, etc. I have put most of this into sharkfund0 also.<br /><br />Whatever performance sharkfund0 gets for the investors, I will personally be getting the same results, along with the asset companies that consolidated into it. So, while you could be right about not being able to match NXT, especially if it goes up 100-fold, investors in sharkfund0 will get the same result as I do. I think aligning the financial interests of the management with the investors is a critical factor in the long term success of any for-profit enterprise.<br /><br />I am currently taking a salary of 0 NXT per month and as long as I have personal liquidity, I dont expect that I will take a salary. The total overhead of all my asset companies is less than $1500 per month and I am planning on reducing that by cutting down the number of dedicated servers now that there are virtual servers that can be paid for in NXT<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. bithaus asset is the only exception as that is a passthru asset and I am not managing the nxthaus operating co in any way, I am just a passive investor in it.

This is a big problem when trading<br /><br />So while theoretically, ripple api would allow similar solutions to be created, the reality was that i had a hard time getting a simple automated market maker to be stable with ripple<br />So, in addition to needed to get users to set trustlines, you have this very real implementation issue and no good way of getting any access to the core ripple devs<br /><br />With nxt i have been able to develop a lot more ambitious set of solutions. One of them is a multisig gateway where every user gets a customized multisig acct and any node can monitor in realtime all the blockchains and track every deposit, asset xfer and withdrawal. So while there is still a gateway, multigateway will have three servers that need to come to complete consensus on each withdrawal and everyone can get full visivility into each step via their local copies of bitcoinwallets and nxt core<br /><br />There are no restrictions on nxt assets, so creativity is the limit. With ripple, it is primariily currency so while you can shoehorn something else into the three letters, it really doesnt fit well with a lot of assers<br /><br />If you read all the asset descriptions, you will understand<br /><br />Anyway, the only ripple devs are working nine to five and that does not have thepassion needed to complete a project of that size in a timely manner. Also ripple is closed, there is no way i would have been allowed to become a key dev for ripple<br /><br />With nxt, there was no way to stop me <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />james,<br /><br />nice!&nbsp; looking forward to the latest updates on your project.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There are three sections in the forum<br />Multigateway++ in technical<br />Nxtventures in asset exchange section<br />Nxtservices in releases<br /><br />Most of my projects are in the above three sections

This is a big problem when trading<br /><br />So while theoretically, ripple api would allow similar solutions to be created, the reality was that i had a hard time getting a simple automated market maker to be stable with ripple<br />So, in addition to needed to get users to set trustlines, you have this very real implementation issue and no good way of getting any access to the core ripple devs<br /><br />With nxt i have been able to develop a lot more ambitious set of solutions. One of them is a multisig gateway where every user gets a customized multisig acct and any node can monitor in realtime all the blockchains and track every deposit, asset xfer and withdrawal. So while there is still a gateway, multigateway will have three servers that need to come to complete consensus on each withdrawal and everyone can get full visivility into each step via their local copies of bitcoinwallets and nxt core<br /><br />There are no restrictions on nxt assets, so creativity is the limit. With ripple, it is primariily currency so while you can shoehorn something else into the three letters, it really doesnt fit well with a lot of assers<br /><br />If you read all the asset descriptions, you will understand<br /><br />Anyway, the only ripple devs are working nine to five and that does not have thepassion needed to complete a project of that size in a timely manner. Also ripple is closed, there is no way i would have been allowed to become a key dev for ripple<br /><br />With nxt, there was no way to stop me <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James
