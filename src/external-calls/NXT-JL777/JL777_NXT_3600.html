The NAS guy was calling his gateway multigateway, but it turned out it was just his centralized gateway. When I complained about the name conflict he agree to change it, not sure if he actually did.<br /><br />Already we are seeing the value of NXT clones create more coinmarketcap value than new BTC clones. This will naturally lead people back to the source of all the new clones.

Locking the NXT requires that the private key of its address be inaccessible. I was thinking along the lines of having each pNXTd node hash the NXT private key with their own key, and only the many hashed private key is known by all the nodes so that all (or many of) the nodes have to agree for the NXT to be unlocked.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/nxtservices-releases/how-to-test-multigateway-with-nxtservices-a-test-user-guide/msg64297/#msg64297">Quote from: jl777 on July 13, 2014, 11:02:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If we can figure out how to ensure the market would peg the price of pNXT to NXT I think this could work.

The problem is there is no assurance of 100% availability of any specific pNXTd node and if any of them was part of the hash chain, then the NXT is locked but a bit too permanently.<br /><br />To begin with, speed and privacy dont mix too well. In fact, I was thinking of having a 1 hour blocktime! The longer the blocktime, the more tx are combined, the more effective the privacy. For someone that wants max privacy, they will simply have to wait hours or even a day.<br /><br />I am thinking of only allowing the pNXTd nodes to actually store the pNXT and this would allow it to all be controlled as a dynamic money supply to go to where it is needed. Also, the automated gateway has a two way peg, NXT -&gt; pNXT and pNXT -&gt; NXT, so if you believe in the floor price, then you should also believe in the ceiling price. It is critical that NXT:pNXT has a fixed price, otherwise privateSend will incur all the usual market liquidity, price spread issues that ripple has and I am designing something to be far better than that.<br /><br />In the event that there is a significant amount of pNXT &quot;lost&quot;, then what can always be done is an adjustment of the exchange rate to compensate. The system would need to suspend all privateSends to avoid any intransit tx from being affected. The exchange rate is revalued, thus recovering the liquidity and I guess that's your answer. The price of pNXT could go up via this mechanism if people hoarded it, but it can be solved and so I dont see it as a fatal issue, more an annoyance. Though it could provide the incentive needed for investors to purchase the pNXT to begin with.<br /><br />Assuming that the malicious agent is mining all blocks and simply not including any actual tx in them, I guess they could effectively stop all privateSends. I am not super familiar with the cryptonote mining algo, but I doubt they allow fake transactions to be mined. In fact I had a really difficult time getting a new blockchain actually accepted. Any little change to anything made all the other nodes reject and blacklist the new node. So, assuming an attacker gets two thirds of the hashrate, I think what they get is two thirds of the block rewards. Last I checked the block reward was down to .00001 pNXT per block, so there is no financial incentive for this attack and I am not sure, but I suspect that if a miner tried to submit a block without any tx in them, when there are tx's to be included, they would get blacklisted. I know enough about the codebase that if that is not already the case, I can most likely implement it.<br /><br />so maybe we need to pester the cryptonote.org guys to see what sort of attack scenarios are possible. I know double spends are prevented, believe me, every node will start spewing red lettered (literally) error messages the moment any double spent key images are seen, let alone in a mined block!<br /><br />safe managing of NXT is the biggest unsolved problem. I am still a bit confused as everything sort of doubles. For every NXT that is &quot;locked&quot; to create the pNXT exchange rate, there ends up being 1 NXT of value created, apparently out of thin air! Maybe this is obvious to money supply economists, but I am just a simple C programmer, it makes my head hurt...<br /><br />So, we sell off the privateNXT, lets make it simple and say 1 million NXT and .01 conversion rate. the gateways are built into every pNXTd, I can see how to make the pNXT flow to where it is needed, but how to get the NXT to where it is needed? We have 1 million worth of pNXT and 1 million NXT, plus privateSends temporarily inject more NXT into the system. We can do the &quot;faster than light travel trick&quot; where NXT in one acct is &quot;transferred&quot; to a remote account, just with ledger entry changes, but that requires enough community NXT at the destination. Really what we need is to have both the pNXT and NXT in the privacyServer system to flow freely from wherever it is, to wherever it is needed. It would be like in a closed system with the pNXT on the other side of the barrier and the NXT on this side. As new NXT comes in for privateSend, it temporarily &quot;mixes&quot; with the community NXT as its counterpart pNXT zaps across the network to where it is needed. Now the same amount of NXT needs to come out of the community NXT to complete the cycle.<br /><br />Maybe we need some magic?<br /><br />James

I already have a task set by a real-world business, but I need more tasks to analyse them and find common patterns.<br /><br />I&#039;m planning to implement dividends by using Smart Contracts. If you are going to use Nxt in your business, please, share how you&#039;d like to exploit Smart Contracts.<br /><br />PS: The idea of Smart Contracts is explained here - <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_idea.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_idea.html</a>. BCNext wanted to write SCs in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">functional language</a>, I'm thinking of making this language similar to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select.asp" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">SQL SELECT statement</a>.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are you trying to kill etherium before it is even born?<br /><img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I remember seeing some organization that had ~20 standard contracts, cant remember the exact URL<br /><br />For my uses, I need to be able to dividend out assets, not just NXT.<br /><br />Also, I would like to be able to transact off-blockchain with signed tx that is a payment guarantee, like a cashier's check. You dont have to worry about there not being enough funds (other than actual bank failure in this case the equivalent would be total NXT failure) The current referenced transaction just has all the issues that I am sure you are aware of. So if I can create a binding trade directly knowing that it will be cleared by the blockchain at some point, then the two parties an operate as if the trade is already done, which in a sense it has been after the exchange of the signed txbytes<br /><br />I am sure I can come up with a lot more use cases if you need.<br /><br />James

I already talked about my view on scrypt coins and investing in GPU farm is a different type of operation where power really comes into play. So places with cheap power have a fundamental advantage, plus what happens to all the GPUs when the ASIC comes out?<br /><br />Also, this is automated multipool so the system selects the highest profitability coin to mine.<br />Now the public hashrate.org pool will (already?) supports all the various options, not sure about cryptonote though. So for people with their hardware, definitely use the public hashrate.org pool. The more BTC hashrate.org gets, the more BTC is available for the NXT -&gt; BTC autopayment module<br /><br />James

I wont be keeping all 60%, the usual 10% will go into jl777hodl and 20% is already in NXTventure. That 20% will either be sold in the aftermarket or distributed out as a dividend, so I will only end up with 30% personally. I hope that is OK? I expect that just via NXTventure holders over 100 people will end up with HRNXTpool<br /><br />This multipool is strategic for NXT as it provides the counter-demand for the NXT-&gt;BTC autoconvert payment functionality that we need. Once we have that NXT will effectively be accepted everywhere.<br /><br />So, not sure how this scares off small investors. Just put your bids in sooner rather than later and they get filled first.<br />
