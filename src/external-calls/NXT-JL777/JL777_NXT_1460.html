All the article does is state that it's valuable (apparently the assertion is enough to prove that).<br /><br />It's really odd that 4 of the top core devs start a startup with venture funding. Sidechains almost looks like a system where Bitcoin core devs decide what is valuable and what is not, like a community committee. It's an absurd idea, in my opinion. But if it's valuable people will use &quot;it&quot; (where I'm not sure what &quot;it&quot; really even is).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I didnt know bitcoin had 4 core devs? who are they? and they are all doing this sidechains thing?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not all bitcoin-devs participate.

It is not about confirming or validating transactions. Yes, the forger also does this, but so does everybody else, and nobody blindly trusts the forger that the transactions in the forged block are valid, everybody re-validates them before accepting the block. What the forger does is create a new block, and he has the freedom to select which transactions will go into that block, and after the 1.4 hard fork even the order in which the transaction in the block will be executed. So it is about creating/generating/composing/forging/casting a block, and selecting/picking/choosing which transactions to be in that block. Words like confirm, validate, certify, just don't express what is happening. The securing of the network part comes from the fact that the forger is using his stake to create a new block at the time he becomes eligible to do it, rather than skipping his turn which would allow somebody with a smaller stake to create a block some time later (which would lead to a chain with a smaller difficulty, more vulnerable to attacks). But the forger doesn't do any extra processing or validation that others don't.<br /><br />In the code I just call the function &quot;generateBlock&quot;. Maybe casting, to keep the forging theme, or &quot;blockcasting&quot;, if we want to invent a new word?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I really like &quot;blockcasting&quot;!<br />has the block for blockchain<br />has the casting, similar to forging<br />and even evokes broadcasting, which in a sense it is doing<br /><br />Can we wave a magic wand and replace all usage of &quot;forging&quot; with &quot;blockcasting&quot;?<br /><br />James

Well, it is not the end of 2014&nbsp; yet <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />But I'm curious, why it was such prediction (reason) and why we are not at 1 USD today? Maybe there is some reason (not enough users, not all planned features online, etc.)? Could people who forecast this ratio explain? One of them, as I remember was CFB <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Main reasons: <br /><br />1. Not enough new blood/money coming into NXT.<br />2. Consistent dumping of the whales who are crashing a price every time it raises a bit.<br />3. Negative image of NXT as the scam coin in crypto/btc world.<br /><br />As you can see these reasons are inter-connected and dependent on each other, meaning that new people that do get in and invest really fast end up in negative since the whale dumps on their head. Then they sell at loss and get out. This limits new people that we need to get in. Price crashes to this 4500 satoshis level where we are now. And we go like this in circle.<br /><br />Also some negative publicity didn't help us. Cointropolis pump and dump scam, bter theft, bluemeanie thing on bitcointalk. I know some will say how there is no &quot;bad&quot; publicity but this is just adding to much to our image of NXT is a &quot;scam&quot; out there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I see what is happening. But my main question should be: why this price was predicted? It was some vision or plan of what should be done to reach this price. If this vision or plan existed, so what is not done today, that price is still 0,02 USD? Whales behaviour, bter theft, bluemeanie and Cointropolis things could not predicted in the beginning of 2014.

Maybe I feel wrong <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>USD monetary supply has gone 4x in last 5 years, but there is no inflation!<br />this is quite an impressive achievement. Anything that isnt ripple cant just quadruple its supply without losing value per unit.<br />So, this is not sustainable. after the 2009 $800 billion bailout that injected enough new money to double the supply, well, nobody really complained, so they did it again, and again, and again, and again!<br /><br />It is no unreasonable to expect a 4x hyperinflation to compensate for this.<br />During the peaks, NXT is reaching 10000+ satoshis, which would be 5 cents to 10 cents with BTC at $500 to $1000<br /><br />With ghash.io always close to 50%, it is likely that serious money will look for an alternative.<br /><br />If we had a USD hyperinflation causing BTC to $5000 and NXT to 20000 satoshis, we actually get $1 NXT, but really it would be the value of 20 cents. <br /><br />Not sure if this was CFB's analysis, maybe he was joking<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I believe NXT $1 will happen, but I have no idea what month it will happen. I do know it will be on a Tuesday

What is the actual benefit of this technology and how does it work? All the article does is state that it's valuable (apparently the assertion is enough to prove that).<br /><br />It's really odd that 4 of the top core devs start a startup with venture funding. Sidechains almost looks like a system where Bitcoin core devs decide what is valuable and what is not, like a community committee. It's an absurd idea, in my opinion. But if it's valuable people will use &quot;it&quot; (where I'm not sure what &quot;it&quot; really even is).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I didnt know bitcoin had 4 core devs? who are they? and they are all doing this sidechains thing?

NXT price of $1 has been delayed due to USA ability to do the roadrunner thing. You know, in the cartoon where he just goes off the edge of the cliff, but doesnt fall. beep beep. When the USD collapses, that is when NXT is $1.

I dont know why you say this is impractical.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Right. The question is also, what such an a successful attack would accomplish. Nxt 2.0 could be rebooted. So while Nxt 1.0 shareholders would lose their wealth, 2.0 would exist and can be used. So the attacker we are talking about must <em>really</em> hate crypto-currencies. But how does he acquire the knowledge to carry out the attack then? <br /><br />The more interesting attacks than 51% are N@S and long-range. Similar arguments can apply there. For example Vitalik Buterin has described some of these, where he simply by-passes the fact, that such attacks would lead to hundreds or thousands of people losing their wealth. That would not go un-noticed, and a hardfork can easily be done. I can't imagine anyone going through all these work. Even if it was profitable to do, there are easier ways to make a ROI. I think we should just improve Nxt to make the trust in core dev more explicit and introduce voting of some kind.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>even without the 720 block time limit, these history attacks just seem nonsensical. Nobody knows who 51% worth of founder stakes are. Even if you managed to find the 20 or so people needed, I cannot imagine many of them selling their old passwords, especially if they still have any NXT left.<br /><br />The thing about N@S attacks I dont understand is that they seem to assume that you can just calculate an infinite number of branches and pick the best ones. But doesnt each account have to have some NXT in it? If you fund it after you find the account, you would need to wait 1440 blocks, so that means you have to prefund these &quot;nothing&quot; accounts, right?<br /><br />So the N@S would have a bunch of 1 NXT accounts at stake. Nobody seems to mention this, or maybe I missed something?<br /><br />James

One has to distinguish between a lot of different scenarios which are not accurately described by the term &quot;attacker&quot;. Is it a black-hat who wants to make a profit? Or is it a mad-man billionaire who is determined to spend his wealth to destroy Nxt? Or is it even those that hold stake anyway, but it is not a double spend. The probability of some of these attacks are sufficiently small to be irrelevant. AFAIK no one has described the detail steps to actually do this, including calculations of the effects on the market price. Certainly it's very far from easy. As far as I can see a complete re-write attack could be reversed by devs with a new release, and it would be 100% obvious what the right chain is. What prevents a 51% re-write of the entire block-chain is that it's not a rational strategy. Even black-hats usually want to make money, not just destroy things and waste a lot of resources.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I have an attack guaranteed to work!<br />I call it the EMP attack!!<br /><br />Just set off EMP's that wipes out all the large stakeholder's nodes, and also all the HDD of everybody running NXT. Also need the password from one of the founders, but that is easy, just PM them and I am sure they will gladly just give up their password. I do it all the time, whenever someone asks me for passwords to my accounts, I just give it to them!<br /><br />Now, since all the nodes have to get a blockchain from somewhere and you have the only node that is running, all the nodes will accept your node as the longest chain!!<br /><br />See how easy that is. I dont know why you say this is impractical.<br /><br />James

So each minute I recalculated a bruteforce set of TA primitives, in addition to all the other features. I think those would work across all markets.<br /><br />just from home computer being almost 1 second away from markets, got a fully automated trading system to breakeven, considering the slippage, fees, etc. and not being very optimized, it was actually quite a feat. The remaining problem was some noise that caused spurious trades and I was just about to fix that when ....<br /><br />I discovered crypto!<br /><br />James

This would mean that if there will be 4B coins as planned, that the price would be 4000 satoshis when looking at the complete supply. This is almost a current price of NXT at the moment. You have to agree that NXT has many features while NEM has only promises with great distribution. <br /><br />Thanks for all the answers. I was thinking about investing more but something tells me that it is better to wait and that NEM will actually be cheaper than it is at the AE at the moment. Reasons: There will be dumping, this is sure. ALT market is getting crushed at the moment, look at all the alt coins and NXT as well. I kind a wish that NEM was launched 2 months ago when things looked better for all of the alt markets. Third reason is that everybody that wanted to buy NEM already probably did on the AE, this is why price is not exploding as everybody expected it will the last few days before the 22nd.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My guess was with 4B coins.<br /><br />But there will be probably 8B coins.
