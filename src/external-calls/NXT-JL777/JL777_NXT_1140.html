He claims that there is an economic incentive in PoW that leads to &quot;a single miner&quot; (or mining pool). This is simply wrong! Why? Because the price of the PoW coin will go down when a miner or pool becomes too big. Why? Because of the risks (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjtgp5h-jEY" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjtgp5h-jEY</a>) that come along with a centralized blockchain. Therefore the economic incentive is to keep mining at least distributed among a couple of bigger pools.<br /><br />2) The real problem with PoW is the LOW COST of a 51% attack. James D'Angelo says a 51% attack could under certain circumstances cost only 20 million USD: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi2thGzzNSs" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi2thGzzNSs</a> If crypto is there to fight fiat it has financially and politically powerful enemies. Low cost of a 51% attack that can destroy a PoW coin becomes a real problem here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So even with the price disparity the cost to attack NXT is comparable to the cost to attack BTC...<br />

I took what you said to heart, and look what you have done!<br /><br />Now I am advocating marketing NXT like it is a semiconductor chip, using technical marketing. Oh, and I did also come up with some few tech projects too.<br /><br />If we ignore the market price, the usage of BTC is double a year ago, so maybe this is not the 10x that the October 2013 bulls were expecting, but still doubling activity year over year is quite good growth. NXT usage has gone from pure speculation to many, many projects that are getting funding, developing new tech and some are already paying dividends.<br /><br />The only people that seem to be still hating on NXT are the ones that have never used it. So the least informed are the most negative about it and the most informed are the most positive about it.<br /><br />We have seen other 2.0 projects get a lot of press, but press does not make a project a success. look at SuperNET vs blocknet. if you would believe the press on that, it is backwards of the reality.<br /><br />Anyway, people have to remember that by any clinical definition the market is totally insane. manic depressive, schizophrenic all out hallucinatorily insane. Should we listen to a crazy guy about NXT?<br /><br />James

But I don't understand why you want to make a lotto. It's a bad idea. Serious investors don't want gambling, they are rational guys. They prefer to receive directly a dividend as waiting for a draw, and hopping for luck.<br /><br />If you want to give a big popularity to jl777, makes a dividend and inform the peoples about it.<br /><br />You know, I'm not a big guy in the cryptoworld but a lot of people ask me about the Assets. And do you know witch kind of asset they ask? Dividend assets.<br />For now, I can't speak about jl777 to this persons because it's an holding thing. But if it's a gambling thing, it has no credibility any more. For me and other serious investors.<br /><br />Why you don't organize the lotto with Privatebet? It's more logical and it's an asset in the good thematic.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">P.S. Note that this method could be used for NXT also, what would happen if all forging fees for the month (week/day?) went into a lotto fund.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can make all you want with your accounts and, finally, you work and pay for the forgings nodes. You can take the forgings fees and make what you want with them, the investors can understand and agree.<br /><br />***<br /><br />If my opinion count, for me the best solution for the promotion of jl777hodl :<br /><br />- Make it sexy for the long term investors : propose a dividend.<br /><br />- Inform the public regularly : you can hire somebody to make a newsletter and post it on forums, websites, etc. It could be monthly newsletter, just before or after the dividend. For sure, you can make a deal with nxter.org or other News websites.<br /><br />In November, jl777hodl account receive 80k NXT. It's enough to make something very efficient for both, dividend AND information. And it's only the beginning.<br /><br />You can decide to use a fix monthly amount for the information work, and the rest goes to the investors as dividend.<br /><br />Really, jl777hodl is a good investment and we can make it more popular in the future.<br /><br />You are the king in your kingdom. It's only my opinion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i am listening to you and watching the volumes of JLH<br />clearly if the volumes on JLH are not extremely good, the ongoing lotto idea is not making sense<br /><br />ok, let us analyze the dividend approach...<br /><br />rounding up to 100,000 NXT per month for 10 million assets = 0.01 NXT per JLH right?<br />this is so small it is embarassing. this is part of the reason for the lotto. a 0.01 dividend per month is quite a little snotkitten of a dividend, so might as well spend it on a promotion.<br /><br />maybe lotto is too controversial, what with the stigma that gambling has in some parts of the world.<br /><br />really, if there was someone I can just pay to make JLH trade at decent volumes around NAV, that could be the way to go, but it is not easy to find people for such work.<br />the dividend process would be a zero after txfees for most smaller holders...<br /><br />I think I will make a poll on the lotto issue, maybe you are representing the silent majority. I do not just want to declare that this is the way it shall be, I want to reflect what the community wants.<br /><br />James

I am proposing to compensate those who really do great work for Nxt (like yourself) and create initiative to make a change. Damelon, Evil Dave and their group has done a lot of great things, so has members of the Nxt Organization, so what I am saying: give these people the funds to do something with. <br /><br />Nxt needs exposure OUTSIDE of Nxt. Regardless of how much crack James smokes, the truth is in the statistics, go to the Facebook page, twitter page, subreddit, forum registrations, visitors on websites. Nxt is not growing. There is transactions on the blockchain between Nxters, but that's not how you GROW. We need Nxt to reach people outside, the 3-500 or so active Nxters enjoying the technology is really good and all, but it's not changing the world.<br /><br />Look at the volume and price of Nxt, it's down over 80%. This is not me fudding, I have a huge incentive for Nxt to win this race and I thoroughly believe in the technology. But Nxt NEEDS to get &quot;out there&quot; and I honestly believe our best shot is to incentivize the active people, which will then make a change, which will inspire others, like we've seen before<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>volume of NXT is actually a bit more than volume of BTC in terms of percentage of marketcap. Is this really an urgent problem? To me it seems like NXT has a lot of long term holders and not so many day traders. Maybe that is no so bad.<br /><br />As far as price, maybe nobody told you about the bear market crypto is in? BTC is down 75% from ATH. smoothing out the peaks and valleys, NXT is down around 50%, but a significant part of that is due to the mining assets cashflow imbalance.<br /><br />Now I am not one to argue against getting NXT out there. That is nice to say, but harder to do. What is your plan for the millions of NXT that will get NXT out there? I came up with SuperNET and NXTinside plans to use NXT as a platform and a few assets. Curious to hear some specific plans of yours on how the money should be spent, other than just hand out money to people and hope for some magical trickle down effect.<br /><br />James

The announcement of NxtHaus also pushed NXT Price up like 30%, prior to it growing again in syngery after Overstock announced talks with NXT, so yeah James, go back to then and see, that was actually the peak of NXT. So yes I have absolutely no problems with being majorly responsible for that peak. Hell, the NxtHaus assets you issued was also the beginning of your empire, when people saw the money you could make on thsoe assets, you decided to make more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and you still haven't stopped, because hey, the rich always wants more.<br /><br />But unlike you, Nxthaus wanted to do things properly. (and have been doing things properly with an imminent launch) I.E. be a serious, public and a transparent actor to give Nxt and crypto acceptance in the *real world* where you can actually make a difference. But in the real world, there is beauracracy, there is regulations, there are problems that need to be overcome which costs money and time. But at the end of the day, you get something real. The same thing I offered to help you with, when you just rejected it and instead wanted to create your own digitized sovereign nation where no rules or laws apply. The anarchists fantasyland. This is also the reason Wesley abandoned your project.<br /><br />I still stand by all of that today, which is why I stopped giving a fuck about your ventures, because it's literally impossible to help you, you think reality don't apply to you or Nxt.&nbsp; So you get mad everytime someone remind you to take your pills.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />many people left NXT specifically because of you and your abrasive manner. Since you sound halfway credible and you are spouting nonsense,&nbsp; I need to discredit you so that people wont start worrying needlessly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Show me one James. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Remember when you were pushing real hard for Isle of Mann crytpo paradise? And I said, that is the wrong path and there is no assurance that one day the bigger fiat govts wouldnt squeeze the IoM to cave into their desires. Within a few months, what happened? where is the Isle of Mann crypto paradise? So you were wrong on that one, but you keep coming back with doom and gloom. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Crypto is actually moving forth on Isle of Man James. I told you that I could help you get setup with YOUR ventures on Isle of Man, and again I stand by my statement that it would be the best option *if* you wanted to actually create something out of these infinite assets you keep issuing. Personally I don't even mind taxes. Philosophically I agree with taxes *on some things*. I am not an anarchist like you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">It is curious that both you and emule are back at the same time. I just put two and two together<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is so beneath me that I wont even... Instead I'll just remind myself that when CIYAM was pushing you out of NXT and we had that long talk where you revealed your past, you gave me quite intimate details of your past and how your mind &quot;works&quot; and believe that this is just your mind caving in, rather than you actually being a bad person.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>CIYAM tried a power grab to become the co-lead dev and with jean-luc always coding, he would have been the guy effectively in charge of NXT development. His priorities were to fire both me and CfB. I fought against that as I felt it would not be good for NXT.<br /><br />It does seem like you are making some veiled threats of blackmailing me with some Oprah stuff. You going to PM me to threaten to post the private conversations next? I stand behind what I have created and started. The SuperNET is doing just fine and all the assets are nearing activation. In any case the source code, even the working repo is all public so people can see what I have been doing.<br /><br />Just like I felt CIYAM was not good for NXT if he became some sort of centralized manager for devs, I dont feel that having you getting access to the public funds will be good for NXT. This is my opinion, am I not allowed to have them? <br /><br />So I am not a transparent actor? When my development repo is actively posted. Over 2700 commits last 8 months, around 40,000 lines of code. Then there are all the people I am working with and helping them with assets. You personify all the assets to being just me. There are dozens and dozens of people actively contributing.<br /><br />You want to talk about transparency? Then why dont you tell us all the projects you are working on?<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. funny you say Wesley stopped working on my projects because of me, when he actually stopped working on all NXT projects a while back. Shall I name the project for you?

So if another few Nxters banded together today, put up a website and came up with a fancy name, they should get an equal share of Nxt with the Foundation and Nxt Org? What about another two groups? Maybe the MGW team know how to spend to improve Nxt? Maybe DoM P's group do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ugh, why do people CHOOSE to misinterpret and misunderstand just to argue?<br /><br />&quot;If a few other Nxters&quot;, inside the Nxt foundation and Nxt organization are people who all have worked on NXT the longest and hardest. And like I just said: the groups are obviously open ( at least Nxt Org is and Nxt Foundation was when formed ) to accepting in new members. DoM P was actually invited and chose to be a non-partisan member, so yea he's covered too.<br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you think you should be trusted to spend money, then why not put your name forward for election to this committee? Or if you have great ideas, you can just put them to the committee after it is elected, and you should have no problem being funded, so it should end up the same difference, no.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I stepped down from the organization 2 months ago due to the fact that I have other obligations that take up all my time, so again your question doesn't apply to me at all.<br />The point here is that it's better to get shit done than not, pretty simple concept you should be able to wrap your head around.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/new-community-funds-committee-(cfc)-members-self-nomination-thread/msg141624/#msg141624">Quote from: JamesList on December 18, 2014, 05:15:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />A lot of discussion moved to slack in case you have missed it. We have gained a lot of longterm users in the past weeks with SuperNET.<br /><br />Which competitors are up? Bitcoin? Litecoin? Dogecoin? Darkcoin? Monero? Blackcoin? XC? Vericoin?<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have not missed it, I say look at the overall data.<br />And competitors up = yes pretty much every other project has been able to bootstrap and establish themselves. NXT had an unprescedented window of oppourtunity as a first-mover in the 2.0 space, we did not capitalize on it. As a consequence we are ranked #14 on volume, which is the most important metric.<br /><br />I cannot fathom how anyone can look at the evolution of NXT in the last 6 months and think &quot;Oh we're doing well&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>They would look at the API that is now vs 6 months ago and the details of the testnet release.<br />Since you are not a coder you dont understand how fast NXT is evolving. Maybe you need to go to ripple? they have&nbsp; &nbsp;a lot of volume so they are the most successful non BTC crypto, right?<br /><br />plz stop posting nonsense
