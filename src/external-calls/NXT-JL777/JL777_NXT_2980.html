Without documentation it's not only harder for the operators to configure up their server, the risk that something was done wrong that could be exploited by a hacker is also much higher. This is what I was trying to fix with my documentation. <br /><br />Being credited twice for one deposit <strong>is</strong> a critical problem. It can be used easily to rob the MGW and all that is needed is that MGW has to run more than once on a server (working on the same coin/set of coins/MGW.conf). If there is no mechanismus build into the code to prevent this situation, it will happen quickly in production. <br /><br />Again, this is critical and needs to be fool-proof (with the fool being the operator). It can happen very quickly that MGW is started twice (sloppy init.d script, started with nohup multiple times by the operator, once again on the command line during debugging, etc.). It should not be possible to start MGW more than once for the same altcoin.<br /><br />Regarding the overall status: As I said it's hard to judge where we stand. Deposits and withdrawals work like a charme for me now, but nobody knows if a simple thing was overlooked that might make it possible to rob the accounts (something like the double-credit problem above), but I guess this is as good as it gets and we as operators have to accept the risk or make the decision to not run a MGW server.<br /><br />My bottom line: Risk accepted. Let's proceed. I'm in. <br /><br />On a personal note: After some PMs, I doubt that all members of Team Zwei will get the complete cluster up and running over the next 4 weeks. Since I am motivated to proceed, I would love to fill a server operator position in case anyone from Team One or the main MGW wants to step out. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I pushed a version that simply exits on any bind error. PLEASE test this to make sure it works!<br />Also, did the &quot;backupdir&quot; JSON field fix the problem with backing up the wallet? Do you have a backups dir from where your coin daemon is?<br /><br />James

With all this selling going on?<br />....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />BTCD volume is real, big money poured into it and a big increase (50%!) in staking volume (like the amount forging in NXT)<br />clearly the price got a bit ahead of itself with back to back to back 50% gains. We are back to more sustainable trendline, the 5% per day increase was happening before this last pump. I think people that got draft copies of DarkPaper got a bit carried away.<br /><br />Anyway, I released DarkPaper to make sure everyone has access to the same info before making decision.<br /><br />Good call on the short term peak. The last pump and dump peak in BTCD was totally eclipsed in two weeks time. All this is based on people's expectations of Teleport tech. So from here it depends on me to deliver. Once I get NXTservices integrated into BTCD core and BTCD GUI is the reskinned NXTservices GUI with NXT inside, then each BTCD install becomes a NXT install.<br /><br />Clearly, there is more volumes from BTCD than NXT, as even during the slow times, BTCD volumes were around what NXT was doing and it keeps getting these anon coin related volume surges.<br /><br />I want to extend NXT's reach via other coins. We make it easy for any coin to get all of NXT 2.0 features with &quot;NXT inside&quot; or &quot;powered by NXT&quot; and while any single coin wont be so big (unless it is DOGE or BTCD), if we get a dozen of them it can easily double or more the size of NXT network<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting - thanks for the insight. Hard to keep track of all the development. <br />Would be great if Doge can benefit too for example - their Litecoin solution seems like an awful short-term hack.<br /><br />I'm surprised that &quot;big money&quot; is still chasing anonymity that hard. They seem very skittish in jumping from crypto to crypto. It's not clear to me what's really going on there, but would be cool if a NXT ally wins out <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No matter who wins anon wars, BTCD will be able to boost its power by teleporting it<br />The reason anon is so important is that big businesses will never use any crypto for any meaningful volumes until they can be sure their competition cant see all their tx.<br />I believe Teleport will provide business level privacy, so there is now a chance for business adoption of bitcoin. Any anon coin that seriously thinks multi-billion dollar businesses will trust any blockchain other than bitcoin, is deluding themselves. I dont know why other anon coins dont make bitcoin dark? It is the only possibility for mass volumes and that is the only chance for a large enough anon set to make statistical correlations into random noise. <br /><br />I am already hearing from several decent sized coins (not top 20) that are interested in joining the Teleport/InstantDEX network. Since it is not using blockchain, there is no hardfork needed and just a matter of integrating some code into the wallet. Of course, NXT will be needed as the AE is of course powered by Nxt<br /><br />I dont know why more people are not excited about white labeling Nxt 2.0 features. As soon as we get half a dozen coins or just 1 top 10 coin to bundle Nxt, then we win<br /><br />James

Also, the exact timing of assets getting sold depends on a variety of factors so while I try to make it monthly, it cannot follow a calendar as far as when the net proceeds becomes available. If there are any net proceeds, then it will get sent out as a dividend within a month.<br /><br />Right now HRNXTpool is in the nearest to becoming net proceeds. After pf is done selling the limited supply of 32000, then NXTventure will sell ~10000, so it is expected that ~10000 HRNXTpool will become available as net proceeds to become dividend.<br /><br />After HRNXTpool will be NXTprivacy and Privatebet. Not sure of exact timing or order yet, have some potential things happening behind the scenes.<br /><br />So, please understand that putting these type of deals together is not like output from a mining rig. It is not on a clock, but when it does happen you will know and then the dividend will flow<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S.

You are trusting it to route packets and if they violate that trust, you simply change to a more reliable server.<br /><br />Telepods sent are verified by spending the unspent outputs, so again there is no trust needed.<br /><br />Since there is no trust needed, there is no deposit needed. Every BTCD node runs the privacyServer code, it is just a matter that home ISP might not actually be able to receive incoming packets.<br /><br />I think it is fair to say Teleport uses a decentralized model.

How are those privacy server working? Is it every BTCD Wallet which automatically is a 'privacy server' or would people need to host a software to enable this feature on a server? And how will this software get verified and trusted, if not directly connected with the blockchain? <br /><br />Thank you so far =)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Every instance of BTCD will have NXTservices integrated into it, so BitcoinDark-qt or BitcoinDarkd, both will be able to be a privacyServer. However, a lot of home users have ISP that will not allow them to accept incoming TCP or UDP connections, so they will kind of be limited as a privacyServer. I am hoping to just use such home machines as localhost privacyServer so the same code paths are followed in all cases. One way to think of it is that you get a bit lower privacy level without using a privacyServer to shield your IP address.<br /><br />There is very little trust needed. Last night, I think I scrubbed the last remaining info leakage the privacyServer gets. All the privacyServer sees is a destination (could be randomly selected intermediate privacyServer), IP address of who is sending (there is certainly no need to register any personal info to use a privacyServer! just use fresh acct #'s to eliminate any correlations), a one time public key, encrypted data. So, even if the privacyServer is run by attacker, they get a nice set of random numbers to try to decrypt and correlate. I wont say it is impossible (Quantum Computers, etc), but sure seems like a lot of work. Much cheaper to send some cute girl to you to get info on you <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I keep waiting, but so far no cute girls have arrived to me. Should I be worried?

Not sure how bulletproof it is, but considering all the scrutiny cryptonote has gotten, I would be surprised if it isnt pretty good. Also note that there is no central server needed to do a cryptonote tx.<br /><br />privateNXT is a normal NXT asset without any privacy. I will be making a marketing with bid/ask spreads of 1%, but others are free to come in lower. I expect that when volumes ramp up there will be both buyers an sellers at exactly 1.00<br /><br />OK, so now you have some privateNXT in your acct. Here comes the cool part! I want NXT to get infrastructure to support TF, sooner rather than later. So I am designing what I call privacyServers to provide privacy services for its customers. Note that you can get a VPS and be your own privacyServer host. In addition to pNXT functions, running a privacyServer will earn you nodecoins. I also got a squid installation tested so you can get an http/https proxy service on the privacyServer. This service costs ~$5 per month, so I figure a 10NXT/mo fee for this would be acceptable and this will allow people to run privacyServer nodes (with NXT nodes) that are not subsidized, but are earning NXT and nodecoins.<br /><br />There is an assumption of trust between you and your privacyServer and if you are running your own privacyServer, I sure hope we can count on this assumption!<br /><br />This creates a hub and spoke model so the ONLY node that actually knows your pNXT cryptonote account is your privacyServer. Now we get to send the privateNXT asset via the blockchain to a specificy privacyServer's NXT address. As long as the privacyServer has a decent number of subscribers, then this leaks only a very little information. Since pNXT wont run natively on Windows, I expect a lot of Windows peoples will become subscribers.<br /><br />Now, I have various API functions envisioned, like pNXT to pNXT (low level debugging), pNXT to NXT acct's pNXT cryptonote address via privacyServer, pNXT to BTC (to solve hashrate.org's problem of converting BTC to NXT)<br /><br />People can also use mgwBTC to purchase pNXT, plus I keep coming up with more useful functions.<br /><br />As far as privacy goes, follow this path:<br />1) You buy privateNXT via AE<br />2) It converts to pNXT at 1:1 (only fee is NXT tx fee and pNXT itself has no fees to encourage lots of traffic!)<br />3) Now you have pNXT in a cryptonote acct that only you and your privacyServer even know the acct # of, let along the one time paymentids on top of that.<br />4) You can ask the privacyServer to send the pNXT to another NXT acct's pNXT acct, but this will actually become a pNXT transfer to the privacyServer of the destination NXT acct. And it goes into a cryptonote stealth acct.<br /><br />I expect the privacyServers to inventory enough pNXT and privateNXT so that there is no need to trust any single pNXT gateway. I think this qualifies as the first decentralized gateway!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I believe this also addresses CfB's objection to cryptonote about having the entire history of tx on the blockchain. Someday QC could crack the encryption and everthing is revealed. However, with pNXT and privacyServers, there is good assurance that nobody will actually know who controls the cryptonote acct. This will also combine well with the CoinShuffle when that is ready<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />is this (cryptonote) still valid? or you converting to teleport<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The privateNXT approach is deprecated by Teleport.<br /><br />NXTprivacy will get 0.1% of teleporting BTC and other coins. NXT will get a big discount on teleport fees<br />NXTprivacy still owns 50%+ of Privatebet and now 30% of cryptocard, which is 0.3% of anon card transaction volumes<br />Also might get some revenue sharing from privacyServers in additiona to teleport fees, but I dont expect it would be anywhere close to the main revenue generators<br />

Can believe that the lock simply scared people on other exchanges. <br />For me this was the craziest trading day yet. The difference between Cryptsy and Bter was for some time more than 0.00001BTC/NXT - good arbitraging scoop. Liquidity was high all along. <br />I'm kinda doubting the Coinmarketcap volume stats - is it really realistic that BTCD has a multiple of the volume of NXT? With all this selling going on?<br /><br />Overall I think today was less due to a single serious whaledump, but rather lots of tunas pooping. Cash was needed for the BTCD pump, and the Ether IPO. Since this is somewhat ongoing, and the upcoming release didn't create hype - I would predict we're in for a longer slog.<br /><br />Good day. Called the BTCD peak right on the dot too. I'm getting better at spotting those - <a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/price-speculation/msg36754/#msg36754" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"> did it also here with NXT</a> in the minute we had the 0.00016 back in June. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>BTCD volume is real, big money poured into it and a big increase (50%!) in staking volume (like the amount forging in NXT)<br />clearly the price got a bit ahead of itself with back to back to back 50% gains. We are back to more sustainable trendline, the 5% per day increase was happening before this last pump. I think people that got draft copies of DarkPaper got a bit carried away.<br /><br />Anyway, I released DarkPaper to make sure everyone has access to the same info before making decision.<br /><br />Good call on the short term peak. The last pump and dump peak in BTCD was totally eclipsed in two weeks time. All this is based on people's expectations of Teleport tech. So from here it depends on me to deliver. Once I get NXTservices integrated into BTCD core and BTCD GUI is the reskinned NXTservices GUI with NXT inside, then each BTCD install becomes a NXT install.<br /><br />Clearly, there is more volumes from BTCD than NXT, as even during the slow times, BTCD volumes were around what NXT was doing and it keeps getting these anon coin related volume surges.<br /><br />I want to extend NXT's reach via other coins. We make it easy for any coin to get all of NXT 2.0 features with &quot;NXT inside&quot; or &quot;powered by NXT&quot; and while any single coin wont be so big (unless it is DOGE or BTCD), if we get a dozen of them it can easily double or more the size of NXT network<br /><br />James

					If there is enough demand for it, I could release more sharkfund0<br />I was thinking of adding significant InstantDEX and NXTprivacy holdings to it as they are significant beneficiaries of Teleport<br />Then sharkfund0 becomes a one-stop shop to invest in Teleport related things<br />If I do this, then sharkfund0 probably would become a not so actively managed portfolio<br /><br />So, let me know if this is good plan or no and about how many sharkfund0 to release.

					Telepod volume<br />One-Eyed Willie keeps most of his treasure in cold storage, safe behind a complex series of traps and puzzles in his favourite cave. For satisfying the needs of day-to-day trading, he requires a number of maps ready to go. As well as ensuring a ready supply of unit hoards (consisting of a single gold coin) buried and ready to go, he maintains a running total of larger-denomination chests and maps. Once he has passed a map on, he always destroys any old copies, just in case they fall into the hands of the East India Trading Company or a gang of enterprising pre-teens.<br />Since it makes sense to create as many telepods as are needed but no more (due to the costs involved in tying up funds), there needs to be a mechanism for satisfying a given level of requests for Teleport in the most efficient manner. Suppose that the demand is for X coins, delivered in batches of standard-denomination pods.<br />We can assume an uncontaminated minipod will always be available from the faucet, since this is cheap to arrange, so the problem reduces to finding the best set of available telepods to fulfil the total required. The older the clone date, the more protection exists. However, a simple ‘first fit’ method will not work so well, as there is also the issue of matching the total amount X with the right denominations. However a simplified approach provides a good starting point.<br />Take the first N telepods, such that the total value of these N telepods &gt;= X, but sum of N-1 &lt; X. It is good practice to prevent telepod sets that have not aged enough from being used, and this can be passed in as a parameter. Using this parameter (or a default), we will also have a list of potential replacement telepods that are a little younger than the initial set, but still older than specified. Ideally, the selected telepods would exactly match X with the least number of telepods used, in order to reduce the number of packets that need to be sent. There may be a deterministic algorithm to solve this perfectly, but with the expected number of telepods and speed of the average CPU, this is a simple problem for a genetic algorithm to find the fittest set. Using a genetic approach also allows flexibility in the criteria for the selection set. Different users may have different requirements.<br />Assuming these requirements have been met, we have the set of selected telepods that now need to be sent to the recipient. In the event there is not an exact match for X, issues arise regarding where to send the change without resulting in contamination. To sidestep this issue, in addition to the minipod faucet that will patch transaction fees, the system also requires a supply of telepods that are of the lowest denomination supported by Teleport. Since standard recommended denominations include 1 and 5, no user will ever require more than 4 of these unit pods. (It makes sense for transporter accounts to store a larger number based on likely estimations of demand, since then more than one Teleport order can be fulfilled without waiting for more telepods to age.)<br />There should therefore always be an exact match between the order sum X and the total value of the telepods. They can then be sent to the recipient, to await confirmation of successful cloning. In order to minimise timing attacks, the acceptance procedure should be randomly spread out over a set amount of time. Again, a user-specifiable parameter with some reasonable minimum requirement is a practical approach. The recipient can also immediately acknowledge receipt of all telepods without cloning, in the case that the sender is trusted not to double spend. While this is not realistic for arm’s-length transactions, for transfers internal to a single organisation it avoids needless cloning and the expenses and loss of ageing that creates. If a user is creating telepods for their own purposes and later use, again there is no risk of lost funds.<br />Upon receipt of acceptance, the sender deletes the telepods. This is a potential (edge case) information leak if the sender prevents deletion, but it can never raise the possibility that an untrusted sender will double spend. It is also in the interest of the sender to delete the telepods, as the sender’s privacy is at risk (again, in extreme cases) as long as these files remain on their system.<br />Receiving telepods<br />Roger the Cabin Boy has received his monthly pay in the form of a set of standard-denomination treasure maps, delivered over the course of the last week by the pirates’ courier network. Broadly trusting his employer, Captain Pugwash, he has a choice about when to move the treasure and copy the maps, and does not have to do this all at once. He decides to wait until Saturday to recover some of the treasure, since many other people will have just been paid and will be engaged in digging. The more people are active at any one time, the less his own activities will raise the suspicions of the East India Tea Company.<br />The final part of the telepod transaction process is reception. As the telepods arrive, they are processed according to the stated trust level and user parameters. In the case of a trusted sender, the telepods are verified to contain proper unspent outputs on the blockchain and acceptance is given. (A higher-level packet that describes the entire set can be used to identify any packets lost in transit and to make the accounting simpler, though this is not required for the proof-of-concept to work.)<br />In the expected event of an arm’s-length sender, the recipient should immediately clone each telepod, thus preventing double spend by the sender. Of course, in the event the sender does double spend, then the recipient simply rejects the payment, or pro-rates the amount double spent. Thus a double spend is an inconvenience but poses no threat of fraud.<br />The cloning process involves taking the unspent amount in the telepod, adding the transaction fee equivalent from the minipod, and sending the funds to a newly-generated telepod address. After the cloning process is completed, the telepods begin aging and can become part of outbound teleports when a satisfactory age threshold is reached.<br />The issue arises of when to clone each telepod received in the set. To simplify the processing logic, it is recommended to await the arrival of all telepods, as specified in the summary packet. This allows a retransmission process to complete before proceeding to the cloning stage. The problem with cloning all the telepods at the same time is that this results in a much easier target to correlate, especially if the total amount is substantial. In addition to a general minimum time to wait before cloning takes place, there need to be provisions for processing larger amounts. Ideally, the total amount being processed by the entire network would be used to determine the recommended duration of the cloning process. Instead of specifying an arbitrary time limit, a privacy level can be chosen such that all telepods are part of a large enough global set. The reception side is far more critical than the sending side, due to the significantly smaller timeframe over which this needs to occur. This may result in delays early on in the implementation of Teleport.<br />As the overall Teleport activity increases, these undesirable delays will be dramatically reduced, or even eliminated totally: Teleport works better and faster the more overall activity there is.<br />Leaving hyperspace<br />Roger the Cabin Boy has won a number of maps in a game of chance. The problem arises that although the maps have changed hands anonymously dozens of times in that form, when he actually needs to spend the treasure in the chests he risks creating a link that could be followed back to him. The simple answer is that all of the maps were originally created by the legendary pirate, Jack Sparrow, and can be traced back to him. (Since Jack knew this all along, this is of no consequence to him.) So Roger can return the maps to Jack Sparrow in return for regular payment in whatever currency he prefers, and there will never be any evidence that Roger has dealt in the maps at all.<br />This system describes the creation and continued use of telepods within hyperspace, or within a set of transactions that have no further relationship with the blockchain and addresses that can be identified by their associations – either other addresses to which they are linked, or other information available through external means.<br />For some privacy-oriented activities, the telepods will continue circulating in hyperspace and will never have to rejoin the main (monitored) blockchain. This would provide the optimum circumstances for using Teleport.<br />There will naturally be cases where users want to cash out telepods so that they can spend the funds within them, outside the Teleport ecosystem. This represents a significant vulnerability. Just as the original creation of a telepod is traceable to the address that first created it, so the address to which the telepod is cashed out for general use will also be visible. <br />Fortunately, there are effective ways to circumvent this problem. Some users will be content to move funds directly into their day-to-day accounts, especially if the transactions are obfuscated by other means (use of mixers, for example, is not precluded by Teleport). However, for the highest levels of privacy, the following methods are recommended:<br />Anonymous bank card. Through a partnership with cryptocurrency payment processor Coinomat, BTCD balances can be withdrawn to a bank card. When funds are sent to the linked deposit address, they appear on the card’s cash balance. This can then be used for online purchases and even ATM withdrawals. If the cards are delivered by mail then there is a potential risk; the ideal solution to this is purchase for cash. This telepod → fiat exit path offers a total anonymous ecosystem for cryptocurrencies. <br />Blockchain withdrawals via the originating account. In many cases, owners will want to ‘withdraw’ the contents of their telepods to the blockchain, in order to use the funds as normal – purchasing goods online directly with the cryptocurrency, converting to other currencies via exchanges, and so on. Since this represents a second point of vulnerability (the first being the original telepod creator), it makes sense to combine the two. Thus anyone wishing to cash out their telepods may do so via the original issuer. To the outside observer, the line of transactions simply follows a loop from the originator back to the originator, via an unspecified number of clone addresses:<br /><br />[Graphic]<br />Input account<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />Transporter account → A → B → C → D … M<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Transporter account ← Z ← Y ← X ← W … N<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />Output account<br /><br /><br /><br />Conclusion<br />Captain Kidd has devised a cipher with which to record the location of his treasure. Whilst adequate for the limited threat posed by his own circle of acquaintances, after the treacherous business with William Legrand he decides that extra precautions would be wise. Kidd uses his cipher to encode the location of his replacement treasure chest, and then buries these instructions in a second location, marked on a treasure map in the established fashion – thereby cumulatively gaining the benefits of both forms of secrecy.<br />Teleport offers robust anonymity for cryptocurrency users – initially BitcoinDark users, though the protocol will allow other cryptocurrencies to be anonymised through the BTCD system for only minimal transaction fees. Teleport’s exceptional level of privacy is achieved not by mathematically superior encryption or more sophisticated mixing processes, but by enabling transaction information to be sent outside of the blockchain within a complete ecosystem designed for privacy from the ground up.<br />It is anticipated that BitcoinDark will naturally compete with other cryptocurrencies offering anonymity features, including Darkcoin and Monero, which use variations of mixing and ring signatures respectively. Whilst no solution can ever be perfect, the addition of a wholly different approach to the current cryptocurrency landscape must be welcomed. The CryptoNote white paper points out that the currency is not considered a full replacement for Bitcoin, but that there are advantages to having competing currencies: these are the circumstances under which innovation and improvement occur. <br />Bitcoin’s immense network effect means that there is little chance in the medium term of another cryptocurrency unseating it. As the established digital currency for internet commerce, it makes no sense for users to switch to another form of cryptocurrency without good reason – though for private transactions they may choose another currency. Nevertheless, Teleport’s versatility as a complete system rather than as an cryptocurrency-specific algorithm mean that in those circumstances where privacy is required by Bitcoin or another ‘transparent’ cryptocurrency, this eventuality is also covered by using BTCD through a third-party service. <br />There is also nothing to stop existing privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies from adding Teleport to their approach, either before or after native measures are taken. This layered use of anonymity protocols will provide exceptionally strong privacy for the most sensitive applications.<br /><br /><br />Further reading<br />Evan Duffield and Kyle Hagen (2014).

					<br />Overview of the BitcoinDark implementation of Teleport<br />Once the infrastructure of a secure network provided by the privacyServers is in place, Teleport becomes possible. BitcoinDark uses an implementation of the Teleport idea to enable trustless private transactions.<br />Teleport transmits funds via telepods by transporters. All the information needed to spend funds is included in the telepod and sent via the encrypted network to the destination. Note that this is not the same as making a transaction itself: the recipient can choose if and when to execute the contents of the telepod. Only at this point is the transaction made from the sender’s to the recipient’s address – though in most cases this will happen immediately to avoid double spending.<br />Each telepod uses a newly-created address for the sole purposes of the teleport. Funds are sent from a transporter account – the originator of any given set of telepods, who will remain on public record – to standard-denomination telepods, which execute transactions of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 coins, and so on.<br /><br />Image: Standard-denomination pods travelling to new owner, being recombined, and sent on to new ones<br /><br />Off-blockchain transfers<br />Captain Ironhook has a treasure-transfer outfit. He hides treasure in various locations and prepares numerous maps, ready to give to customers, but leaves them to age and yellow in his office. So long as he does not need to spend the treasure himself, there is no disadvantage to this approach. Quite the opposite, since older maps are likely to raise less suspicion than new ones, on which the ink is still drying.<br />At this point, there is no activity on the blockchain. The telepod is in ‘hyperspace’, outside of the blockchain. The funds within it have not yet been spent, and so they remain in the issuing transporter’s account. If the recipient trusts the sender to not double spend, these telepods can simply remain in storage – the longer the better. Under normal circumstances this will not be the case. However, there may be conditions when this occurs, either where there is a transaction between trusted parties, or where the sender and recipient are the same person.<br />The normal case will be that the recipient immediately clones the telepods. This involves executing the transaction held within them, so that the sender cannot double spend, and creating a new telepod using the funds released. After cloning is completed, the recipient can credit the sender with carrying out proper payment.<br />Because the address to which the telepod has been sent has never been used before, and will never be used again after the telepod has been passed on, it is still considered to be in hyperspace. There is no interaction with an address that can be linked to other addresses through the blockchain, save for the originating transporter account.<br /><br />Image: complex web of addresses, with one-dimensional clone line from telepod originator<br /><br />No blockchain bloating occurs: there has just been a single ordinary spend transaction. And, whilst the blockchain records the fact that the telepod has been cloned, there is no information available – on or off the blockchain – about who carried out the cloning. Save for the transporter account that created the initial telepods, all telepods are clones of prior telepods, with no transaction history of their own outside of that line. The contents of a telepod are identical to the one that existed before it, with the same amount of funds being passed on to the new clone. (Over time, transaction fees will reduce the amounts in the telepods, but this can be ignored for now.) The address of the first telepod is known, though if this account itself was a fresh account funded via semi-obsfucated sources such as an exchange, then even the identity of the original creator can be in doubt.<br /><br />Example<br />Alice creates a new telepod (TP). She sends this telepod to Bob, who immediately clones it (TP’) and sends it to Catherine, who also clones it (TP’’). <br />On the blockchain, it is evident that the unspent outputs for TP were used to create TP’, which was then used to create TP’’. This only traces back to Alice, since the addresses TP’ and TP’’ have never been used before, and are only used once to clone the next generation of telepod. So long as the telepod is not spent in the normal way, in a correlatable transaction, the only thing the blockchain shows is that somebody – maybe even Alice herself – cloned TP and TP’.<br />The telepods are cloned and passed around to conduct commerce in private. Only the immediate sender and recipient know about each other, and even that can be prevented by using onion or broadcast routing. This enables totally anonymous donations, by means of a telepod sent via broadcast using a one-time throwaway public key and sending address.<br /><br />Privacy gains<br />The East India Trading Company keeps a record of every transaction it makes in its ledgers, protected from unwanted readers by a sophisticated code. Captain Pugwash uses a similarly complex code, but instead of recording transactions between people like the Company, he prefers to use his system of maps and leave the question of creating an identity for the new owner to decide. Even if his code is broken at some point in the future, there will be nothing to track that leads back to them, unless they want it to.<br />Although mixing and ring signatures provide a significant degree of anonymity, they are both vulnerable to advances in computing that would render them worthless. In the case of ring signatures, there is doubt as to who is sending coins due to R different signatures being possible. With real-world usage of R=10, this gives results of 10 percent → 1 percent → 0.1 percent for each generation. However, all these transactions remain on the blockchain, and so if at any point in the future the encryption is cracked (which may be possible with advances in quantum computing), then a ring signature blockchain will become as transparent as Bitcoin’s blockchain is now.<br />Let us assume that the attacker has somehow detected that an account is using Teleport. With proper use of privacyServers, this information should be very difficult to determine, and so this is an extreme scenario. Nevertheless, this case assumes that a user is known to have cloned a number of telepods during some specific period of time.<br />There are two concealing factors here. One is the total number of telepods cloned during this interval. Whilst Teleport remains its infancy, this number could well be smaller than 10, and thus provides less privacy than ring signatures in this respect. However, as the corresponding network grows, ring signature solutions will suffer from extreme blockchain bloat, and so the protection offered is relatively fixed: a ring signature with 10 keys is viable, whereas one with 100 or 1,000 is not. Conversely, though, as Teleport usage grows, the privacy level automatically increases at the same rate. 1,000 clones in the given interval means a 1/1,000 chance of being identified correctly.<br />To receive a telepod, somebody must have sent it. On the sender’s side, the situation is even more favourable. The possible senders to be analysed are all possible prior recipients from the time the specific telepod was cloned. In order to gain more privacy, telepods simply need to be stored for a longer period of time. If the receive side is at 1/10 probability and a telepod is stored for 100 times the reception window being used, the correlatability of the sender is 1/(10 * 100). Similar to the situation on the receiving side, the more Teleports that occur, the greater the privacy – all without any blockchain bloat.<br />In the case that the encryption for Teleporting is broken by advances in quantum computing, there is far better long-term protection than any system that records everything on the blockchain. Since the Teleporting is carried out off blockchain, there is no permanent record to be analysed: what happens in Teleporting, stays in Teleporting.<br />Funding transactions<br />Every time a map changes hands, the treasure must be moved to a different location determined by the new owner for safekeeping. The only way to achieve this is by hiring a cart to carry it. Therefore every time treasure is moved, it logically follows that a cart must have been acquired for the purpose. By following this line of inquiry with local (and usually cooperative) cart providers, it may well be possible to establish the identity of the customer. Thus the necessity of carrying out a small transaction threatens to compromise the secrecy of the whole undertaking. Since providing facilities to move treasure and create new maps in secret is fundamental to the health of the pirate economy, it is deemed prudent to make a set of carts available for general use at no cost to the users.<br />In the overview above, transaction fees were ignored for the sake of simplicity. In a real-world implementation, though, these fees significantly complicate matters. Of course, each telepod could pay the fees out of its own balance every time it was cloned, the minor loss being the minimal price that the new owner pays for privacy.<br />However, this would necessarily mean that the telepods no longer had the same values, destroying the advantages of creating standard-denomination pods (resistance to Mantissa analysis). Information would be leaked, which could lead to compromised identity. This means each telepod needs a small additional input to offset the transaction fee and keep its value constant. Since this transaction fee input must come from somewhere, it risks contaminating the entire telepod and leaving a trail back to the owner or another party in the system. <br />Finding a clean source of change is critical. This source is called a minipod. Minipods could be created in several ways.<br />One approach is to simply wait for a (small-denomination) telepod to arrive, and then use this as the minipod. One small telepod can be kept in hyperspace by the owner, and used to fund all other telepods required for the foreseeable future (since transaction fees are typically very small as an overall proportion of the funds being transferred).<br /><br />Image: faucet payment and main account combining for transaction to next owner<br /><br />Arguably a better solution is to have a minipod faucet that sends out pre-made and pre-aged minipods on request, via the encrypted network. Ideally, large numbers of minipods will be created in the same block so they all look the same. Let us assume that this mechanism is available. Now, when the transaction fee is replaced when cloning a telepod, it will link back to the original creator of the telepod line, and to the faucet (which is itself a telepod issuer).

					<br />Part II<br />Teleport: a new approach<br /> Teleport is a different approach to privacy that seeks to use one of the very features of cryptocurrency networks that limit anonymity under normal circumstances: transaction linkage. Teleport occurs off the blockchain but is verified using the blockchain, utilising the benefits of a public record without suffering its drawbacks.<br />Teleport uses ‘telepods’ – packages of information containing everything required to make a transaction – to transfer funds securely and outside of the blockchain to the intended recipient. The recipient may or may not choose to remove the funds from ‘hyperspace’ at this point, depending on whether they trust the sender (in most cases, they will not; however, the eventuality that trust exists or that sender and recipient are the same person must be considered).<br />Key to Teleport is that users are sending the capability of making a transaction to their recipient, not actually making a transaction to the recipient.<br />Similar to the example of the pirate’s treasure map, an illustration can be made by analogy with Bitcoin paper wallets. These can be printed out and mailed to another person, who sweeps the balance into a new address that has never been used to stop the first owner from spending it. They then print a new paper wallet. The balance of an account may change hands many hundreds of times in this way. The only evidence on the blockchain is a series of anonymous addresses, with just one incoming and one outgoing transaction each, leading back only to the first owner. <br />In the original Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto anticipated the privacy issues that a public and transparent blockchain would raise, and suggested using a unique address for every transaction as a solution: <br />‘As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.’<br />However, even if every user avoided compromise through transaction linkage by following this as best practice, transactions could still be traced through other means, including Fingerprinting and Mantissa correlations. Teleport dramatically reduces exposure to all of these.<br />One-time addresses used to avoid Transaction linkage<br />Off-blockchain transmission and variable redemption time mitigates Fingerprinting<br />Standard denomination telepods to circumvent Mantissa correlation<br />Before describing Teleport in more detail, it is necessary to summarise the conditions and infrastructure within which transactions of telepods should occur, and what this enables.<br /><br />Prerequisites for privacy<br />Captain Morgan recognises that although the system of using maps to carry value rather than handing over treasure itself is effective, the participants could potentially be identified if they were seen together or if a trail could later be reconstructed from one to the other. Not wishing to be compromised in any way, he adopts a complex but highly effective strategy of disguising himself as a barmaid, using backstreets rather than main thoroughfares to get to the rendezvous point, and only travelling at night.<br />The public record of the blockchain is the primary threat to users’ anonymity under normal circumstances. Clearly, if transaction information is being sent off-blockchain, then communication between users must be kept private if overall anonymity is to be maintained. In the case of BitcoinDark (BTCD), which uses the measures described below, the necessary features are built into the client to enable the full benefits of Teleport. Teleport will also enable the anonymisation of other cryptocurrencies, for a minimal transaction fee.<br />The most basic privacy required by users is the ability to keep their IP address from being discovered. Any efforts to ensure the privacy of cryptocurrency transactions can be rendered useless by allowing third parties to trace this. For example, if a private cryptocurrency payment is sent to an online store but the user’s IP address is visible, all payments received around that time are probabilistically linked to that computer. Information gleaned from the shipping address and any other personal details submitted can quickly be pieced together to discover the customer’s identity.<br />PrivacyServers<br />Captain Morgan refines his secret messaging plan by enlisting the help of a community of like-minded pirates to act as couriers for different sections of the journey. Each one passes the message to the next, until the final one gives it to the recipient and records delivery to satisfy Captain Morgan’s rigorous accounting procedures. To ensure that none of the couriers is compromised, each one only receives instructions on where the next courier is located when he is given the message. Couriers have no idea of the identity or movements of previous or subsequent couriers in the chain.<br />The solution to the problem of information leakage is the privacyServer. Any user can run their own privacyServer simply by running a VPS, so there is no need to trust any third party other than the VPS provider. <br />The privacyServer is only able to see who a given user is in contact with, since all communication other than the initial setup and intentionally public information is fully encrypted using Daniel Bernstein’s Networking and Cryptography library (NaCl). A session-based keypair is generated at the beginning of every session, so even in the event of any single key being compromised, exposure is time-limited. Additionally, all communications are time-stamped and tokenised to provide verification that an account is not being spoofed.<br />Using onion routing, the encrypted packet sent to the privacyServer only has the address of the destination and the encrypted data. The privacyServer sends the encrypted data to the destination. (Currently this information leakage is deemed to be minor; however, in order to address this an additional onion layer will be added, so that a random privacyServer will be chosen to be the destination that the user’s privacyServer sees. Thus even the user’s own privacyServer cannot glean any useful information. This protects against breaches at the level of the VPS provider.)<br /> Graphic:<br />&quot;xxx&quot;.() indicates the contents of () are only decodable by &quot;xxx&quot;. [] indicates a data packet [user’s privacyServer.([jump privacyServer.([actual destination.(encrypted data)]))]<br /><br />Anyone monitoring internet traffic will only see that a user has sent a packet to their privacyServer. If the user’s privacyServer has been infiltrated, it will be known that they are sending via the jump privacyServer, which was chosen at random. This randomly-selected jump privacyServer will have to be compromised even to find out the final recipient to whom the package was ultimately addressed. As a rule, the encrypted data is also tokenised so that the final recipient can be confident that whoever sent the message at least had access to the sender’s account password. <br />Broadcasting<br />Rather proud of his courier network, which he knows will satisfy the vast majority of treasure movers’ requirements, Captain Morgan nevertheless wishes to develop a premium service that offers still higher levels of privacy for his corporate clients. Understanding that an organisation with unlimited resources (such as the East India Trading Company) could theoretically infiltrate part of his network and learn some information about his business dealings, he hits upon a new idea. Instead of passing the map from one courier to the next in person, he will arrange to have each one simply display a version of the message in a public place such as the market, for anyone to see. So long as he can write it in a form that only the intended courier will understand, there will be no trail at all between any of them. Indeed, if he is careful, no one else will even know what they are looking at...<br />Once effective privacyServers exist, point-to-point secure communication is possible. This is a prerequisite for secure implementation of Teleport.<br />There are remote possibilities in which some path information is obtainable, so for the most secure communications, a broadcast path will be used. This simply takes the form of:<br /><br />[Graphic]<br />[broadcast.(encrypted data)]<br /><br />In this instance, there is no stated destination address. Although it may seem contradictory to broadcast a message to the entire network to maintain privacy, by sending it to everybody the same amount of information is leaked as sending it to nobody, since everybody is treated the same.<br />In addition to the destination address the public key of the sender is also sent. This allows the receiver to decode the encrypted packet. If this public key is the same as the public key broadcast, then it is the same as announcing who the communication is from; therefore a second keypair is used for these broadcasts. This can be a one-time keypair in each instance. In order to be able to encrypt the packet in the first place, the destination’s public key needs to be known. However, this public key can simply be broadcast in plaintext. <br />The encrypted data is broadcast using this public key. All of the nodes will try to decode all of the broadcast packets, but only the intended recipient will be able to decode it successfully: everyone receives the packet but to everyone except the intended receiver the contents are meaningless.<br />Multi-signature capability<br />One final refinement affords Captain Morgan maximum peace of mind that his messages will not be intercepted. Whereas previously he has sent copies of the full map, albeit indirectly, he decides to copy the map several times, cut it into pieces and use his marketplace system to give them all to members of his courier network. To complicate matters further, a proportion of the couriers in the chain are instructed to destroy their pieces of the map rather than to pass them on. The final recipient will slowly be able to piece together the map from fragments delivered at random, but anyone observing or any spy in the network will never know the whole picture.<br />Additional security measures can be established against an attacker that is able to log all the packets between nodes and infiltrate some privacy servers. To this aim, an ‘M of N’ approach to receiving a packet is suggested. <br />At the point of transmitting a telepod, each one is split into N pieces and sent to N random recipients, with a random number M of these forwarding to the final destination. This incorporates aspects of another onion layer, but with M of N ability a statistical retransmit will create additional obstacles for correlation.<br /><br />Image: 6-of-8 representation for reconstructing data<br /><br />For example, if M = 6 and N = 16 (that is, each telepod is split into 16 pieces and 6 are required by the recipient), and each receiving node has a 50 percent retransmit chance, then on average 8 parts will get through, which is enough for the receiver to reconstruct the message. In the event that not enough pieces arrive, a confirmation packet is not sent back to the original sender, who will then retransmit. This return path can also be M-of-N split sent to minimise the correlations that are possible. The BitcoinDark implementation explored below will allow values of M and N up to 254.<br />If a significant percentage of nodes are participating in retransmission, then when a node initiates a Teleport, doubt is necessarily created as to whether it is a retransmit or the start of a Teleport. (This requires the introduction of random delays between receipt and rebroadcast.)<br />A separate use case for the M-of-N approach is to be able to create distributed cold storage of telepods. One part can be placed in encrypted online storage, another on an offline medium such as a USB drive. With a 2-of-3 approach, the final part cannot be used without one of these other pieces. One application would be for donations to be split among a group of N people, M of whom would need to produce their telepods for the funds to become available.<br />(Note: the ‘multisignature’ capability used by BitcoinDark is actually an implementation of Shamir’s Secret Sharing, though this has the same effect of requiring some or all parts of a packet of information to be combined to reconstruct the data.)<br />By selecting different levels of privacy, different levels of onion routing and broadcasting can be chosen. Maximum privacy is unnecessary for non-sensitive matters, especially since the more privacy is required, the longer the transaction will take to complete.<br />
