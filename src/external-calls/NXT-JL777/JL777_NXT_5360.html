We transport people from being fiat based to NXT based. Each qualified new NXT'er makes all of NXT stronger.<br />I would think that a lot of people who have tons of NXT wouldnt mind doubling their forging income and we combine the job center with the bank!<br /><br />New NXT'ers will be able to get oriented, matched up with the NXT company that can most effectively use their skills and if that company cant prepay the labor costs and the new person cant survive without income, then this doesnt happen. NXTbank steps in, upfronts the NXT company so they can prepay the bounty. Now if the NXTcompany makes bad judgement soon their credit rating is no good and people within the NXTcompany need to work off their debt to other companies.<br /><br />I think this allows us to grant loans to an already trusted set of people, who are essentially vouching for their new hire and all of NXT benefits.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not a bad idea, but in order to make it decentralized and perfect, we must somehow eliminate the trust issue, so the system works automatically, no tolerance.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>not sure how you can eliminate trust without collateral?<br />my scenario has the effective beneficiary of the loan providing labor in exchange for the loan. How can you decentralize and make that trustless?<br />

					We need to establish acceptable AE issuer behavior guidelines. I know it isnt hard to create puppet accounts to bypass any guidelines, but at least we can define what is acceptable and what is not. Then issuers can state whether they will comply with the guidelines and this can be recorded by the rating agencies. We can also have violations reported or even automatically tracked.<br /><br />For all the decentralization extremists, please note that this is totally voluntary and the usage of this information is also totally voluntary so I believe it should be something that I am allowed to do!<br /><br />My concern is with market manipulation to create the illusion of demand (or offers) to push the price artificially. I know this is standard behavior in crypto, forex and the stock markets, but why cant NXT have the most honest market?<br /><br />I propose the following:<br /><br />1. The issuer will not make trades with accounts it controls that creates price movements or trade volumes that are false.<br /><br />2. It is acceptable for the issuer (directly or indirectly) to create a market in its own issue as this creates liquidity for asset holders. The vast majority of bids should be below the lowest ask and the vast majority of asks should be above the highest bid. (100% conformance to this cant be assured as there is no control of incoming quotes)<br /><br />3. Publicly announced trades will have no restrictions, but have to be done using the issuing account. This allows for buybacks and secondary market offerings and even market interventions. The key is that it is open and announced.<br /><br />I, of course, promise that all my assets will follow the above and I hope the other asset issuers will also make the same pledge.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Any improvements to the language or additional suggestions are welcome, this is just a first draft, once we have consensus among issuers I hope that daedelus will include this info in his wonderful list

Removing the asset list completely, and also removing the ability to search by name (which is useless), solves the problem with asset list spam, and makes sure no user will be mislead to buy a fake asset.<br /><br />Yes, we can discuss fancy collaborative filtering solutions and rating of assets and asset issuers, but implementing those will take time. And I am not even sure this belongs to the client. Let others build websites dedicated to rating and filtering assets, we can provide just the platform for listing and trading those assets. Indeed, we cannot be both decentralized and yet try to certify or approve assets in any way. We should focus on only providing the decentralized platform.<br /><br />This may also have a legal implication and relieve us from being responsible for hosting an asset which is not legal to purchase or offer for sale in some jurisdiction. The user will always need to start his search for an asset from somewhere else - a website, forum, or personal communication, but it will not be our software that offers assets for the user to purchase - in fact it would be impossible to use our software to find an asset to buy, unless you already have its id or issuer account id from elsewhere.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I propose it starts with a blank slate.<br />Then the user can manually activate asset they want or they can preload a list from a URL of their choosing<br />Since it starts blank, there can be no liability<br />Since the user is the one that selects the rating list URL, it is decentralized<br />please dont make me manually add all the interesting assets.

NXTbank steps in, upfronts the NXT company so they can prepay the bounty. Now if the NXTcompany makes bad judgement soon their credit rating is no good and people within the NXTcompany need to work off their debt to other companies.<br /><br />I think this allows us to grant loans to an already trusted set of people, who are essentially vouching for their new hire and all of NXT benefits.<br /><br />James

I see it more as a &quot;low income&quot; loan program to deserving community members who maybe dont have enough liquid assets to be able to ratchet themselves up to the next level. Think small business loans. These loans shouldnt be for gambling in the markets,but for people who need expense money to create stuff for the NXT community. I dont expect this to generate much profits, just enough to cover lost forging fees and default rates, maybe some compensation for the person who prescreens. By managing it properly, it would become a safe place for people to park their NXT and get double the average forging rate and in turn the deserving people in the community would be able to get the loans they need. I think the asset in this case would just go in proportion to the deposits and there could be voting by the depositors on whether to approve the loan. yes, I like that! I dont think anybody would have a problem in letting the biggest depositors have the biggest weight on loan approving.<br /><br />Having been on the poor side of the fence relatively recently, I can distinctly remember knowing how to be able to make money, but not having the means to do it. I sure wished there was a bank that would have made a loan to me based on what I could do and my track record, instead of looking at a computer printout that said I had no loan history, so that disqualified me for a loan?!? With that logic, how does anybody ever get a loan? What if we had a bank that was rational and made sense?<br /><br />I think we also should be able to have the option to change the loan to a grant in special cases. Maybe the unused NXTcash funds could be allocated for this.<br /><br />If they dont have collateral, they would pledge their time to work off the debt in case they cant pay it back, so the skillset they have is important. Speaking of which I just thought of another piece of the puzzle!<br /><br />We need a job center. A place where people can go to find jobs and also for employers to find talent. As it is I dont know of a single place where this can be done. It can be as simple as a forum section<br /><br />James

This would require 24/7 coverage, but it would just require looking at the withdrawal and making sure nothing jumps out as wrong and clicking an approve button. Not sure we will be able to get volunteers to cover the clock and there shouldnt be too many withdraws at first. After we get enough withdraws without any problems, then we could think of letting go on autopilot.<br /><br />James

But silver for example is not to be expected to explode in value. Rather it would be a hedge for the case that NXT collapses. <br /><br />It gets more complicated if I expect a company to keep the NXT it got from selling it's shares. Then the value of the company rises - but we typically don't have this information about the current enterprises that issued.<br /><br />Overall it seems quite a bad deal then. Should NXT tenfold in value, I lost out unless the company I invested in also tenfolded. Should NXT totally crater, then I can expect most companies to crater too as they depend on the environment. <br />Downsides at both ends?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If NXT goes up tenfold in value and the asset represents a purely NXT oriented revenue/profit stream,then the asset will have kept pace, even if its NXT price hasnt changed.<br /><br />I think the thing to do is analyze the asset's inputs and outputs and if it is all in NXT, then there is no issue here. In fact in the presences of a tenfold increase assumption, it is pretty safe to assume business is doing very well and it will have increased it profits. In that case, the asset would have been better than NXT<br /><br />Now if the asset represents a business that isnt purely NXT based, then the NXT changing in price needs to be taken into account. There is no universal way to analyze this as each asset is different.<br /><br />Certainly if NXT implodes, then it is likely the asset will not do well either. So the opposite is a reasonable assumption to. What this means is that if you purchase an asset at its fair market value, it acts as sort of a leveraged bet on NXT. if you purchased above fair market price, then you can still do well, but the odds are against you. So, the best case scenario is to purchase a pure NXT oriented asset that is undervalued and then have NXT go up tenfold<br /><br />James

Other than BTC, LTC, DOGE and DRK other coins will have to pay a listing fee to cover the costs of supporting a new coin. Not sure what these costs are. We might also have a &quot;vote&quot; where people vote with their crypto. The one that votes the most in BTC equivalent wins.

The key is to match the loan amounts to the trust that person has earned. There can also be collateral deposited to secure part or all the loan.<br />I have been ripped off many times in the real world, always when there was a contract to justify that it was something I supposedly agreed to!<br />In crypto, I have sent people thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars without any contract and not once have I been ripped off.<br />I am sure that there are people that will do bad things online, but I think the vast majority of people, especially NXT peoples are good honest people. Maybe this is because most of the bad peoples are doing hacking and other nefarious things?<br /><br />Anyway, it will be the duty of the loan approval committee (something for voting system) to determine whether the loan should be granted and over time a default rate will be established. Unfortunately this cost will need to be passed on to the borrowers, or maybe shared by depositors and borrowers both.<br /><br />James

					Some of you might have noticed that I am ranging across a wide range of fields, not just tech-assets. NXT will become a global economy that is truly global and spans the world and many industries. NXT is the future of money.<br /><br />So, I was thinking that we should explore all the usual suspects to make sure the NXT economy had all the things it needs to function smoothly. I personally dont like banks much and with the built in money functions of NXT, a lot of what banks are used for is already in place.<br /><br />There is at least one area though that is not covered, namely loans.<br /><br />I believe I have a method to enable good old fashioned loans, secured and unsecured, but I am not sure if there is either the supply of NXT that people want to deposit and collect interest on, nor if there are people that want to borrow NXT and pay interest for it.<br /><br />If there is enough people who would want to get loans, even if there is nobody else that wants to make deposits, I could put some personal funds in. I would also need someone to be the local banker. I am pretty sure one of the autoDACs will be able to automate the bank functions, so if anything this will pave the way for characterizing the types of loans that are in demand<br /><br />If anybody knows of any other &quot;economy&quot; component is needed, let me know.<br /><br />James
