This is inconsistent and would only cause confusion.<br /><br />Anyway, the only change you need to do at the moment; is decide whether your AM will be binary or text. <br /><br />If text, DO NOT hex encode, and set &quot;messageIsText&quot; to &quot;true&quot; (or don't add it). <br />If binary, hex encode and set &quot;messageIsText&quot; to &quot;false&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The AM's are mixed binary and text, I cannot decide what option to do. You can easily make the changes to MGW code and make a new release that is compatible with the new NRS<br /><br />What of the encryption options? If the default is to encrypt, that will break MGW as the info needs to be publicly available and this assumption is everywhere<br />MGW currently doenst have messageIsText and it seems this means it should not be hex encoded, so that means MGW breaks<br />Why cant the message be scanned and autodetect if it is hex encoded?<br />is any backwards compatibility testing being done?<br /><br />James

My assessment is that this will break MGW and for no apparent reason. Default behavior could have easily been made to be backward compatible, but NXT release procedure is flawed.<br /><br />NXT core changes are made without regard to impact on production systems that are dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars in transactions. But this is OK, because it isnt much work for all the NXT API users to make some changes, go through regression tests and all this while having a parallel system live and possibly in an unknown state.<br /><br />My reaction to this is to refuse. I refuse to make these changes caused by<span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong> ARBITRARY NXT API BEHAVIOR CHANGES</strong></span> that are not due to any security issue (the only standard that should require breaking backward compatibility)<br /><br />I am told it will be easy to make these changes. Well, is it easy to do hundreds of hours of live beta test? If the code changes, the beta test needs to restart. So we delay MGW for what reason? Because the default behavior of API is changed arbitrarily by someone that doesnt care about the impact of such things. Its not the problem of NXT core guys to fix all the apps they break.<br /><br />Well, since I am not going to fix MGW for this and there is no other MGW dev, this means unless NXT core guys maintain backwards compatibility of API behavior, they are taking MGW offline indefinitely<br /><br />James

It is not the magnitude of change required, it is the fact that ANY change is required.

If you think that somehow people in developed countries are superior to ones in third world due to where they were born, then we have bigger differences in understanding things.

					I found out that it is highly likely that the current 1.2.5 release will most likely break MGW. While the code changes required are probably minimal, since big money is at stake, if it does turn out not to be backward compatible I will take MGW offline at DGS block.<br /><br />I suggest that people either protest to make sure the new release is 100% backward compatible, or to withdraw everything from MGW. Either way is fine by me. The latter will allow for clean migration to production servers. The former allows me to not worry about this right now.<br /><br />I really cannot be keeping up with the daily new releases. Once I finish something, it is nice if I can assume it will continue working without a new release breaking backward compatibility.<br /><br />Simple syntax changes like &quot;Account&quot; -&gt; &quot;AccountId&quot; seems like no big deal, except it breaks software that is looking for &quot;Account&quot;<br />why such changes are made is a mystery to me, it has no value and &quot;Account&quot; could have stayed &quot;Account&quot; and not caused breaking of already debugged and working apps.<br /><br />All of these new encryption modes and features are nice, but when default behavior breaks things then I do not like it. Please find a dedicated MGW dev or make sure NRS releases are backwards compatible. <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>API behavior needs to be stable</strong></span><br /><br />James

In the asset transfer JSON, only message is used.<br /><br />All message*, encryptedMessage*, and encryptToSelf* parameters can be added to any transaction type, in addition to the regular attachment. <br /><br />message is a public message, non-encrypted. It can be utf-8 text, if messageIsText=true, or a byte array as a hex-encoded string, if messageIsText=false. If messageIsText is not specified, the default is binary before DGS block (for consistency with current AM's) but text after DGS block.<br /><br />messageToEncrypt is a private message, readable by sender and recipient only, and will be encrypted by the server. Whether it is text or binary is again signified by messageToEncryptIsText parameter. If you prefer to do the encryption client side, submit the message in already encrypted form as encryptedMessageData and encryptedMessageNonce; messageToEncryptIsText still applies.<br /><br />messageToEncryptToSelf, etc, are same as the above but encrypted to the sender only - to be used for private notes, like a personal record of what the transaction is about.<br /><br />Those are not exclusive, all three types of messages can be attached to the same transaction.<br /><br />Arbitrary Message transaction type can still be used, again with any combination of the above three message types attached, or without a message at all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am assuming that the new release was backwards compatible with the current version as if it wasnt it could break things that are actively being used, like MGW.<br /><br />Looking at these changes, I think that maybe MGW will totally stop working or do unpredictable things at this DGS block, which is how far away now?<br /><br />MGW uses AM and it cannot be encrypted, it has binary header and JSON text<br />It also uses asset xfer with a JSON text comment<br /><br />Did you break the running MGW with the new release? And if so, I have how long to fix and verify?<br /><br />James

Third world countries don't have a historical need to maintain a facade of democracy and can outright ban cryptos and disallow merchants to accept them without raising too many eye brows from populations. Populations are generally not educated to understand the benefits of cryptos either. And access to cryptos involves non-trivial procedures as well as paying a large premium. With the absence of savings in banks, which could be one big incentive to rush to cryptos in the western world, third world countries will be the last to adopt cryptos, I think.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Russia and China banning cryptos so they are third world countries?<br />The more powerful the country, the bigger threat crypto is<br /><br />Of course people like me who live in third world countries, we can barely use a computer and there is no way for us to understand something as complicated as money. We are lucky to have running water and electricity.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Have you traveled the world recently? I have found people all over the world are in pretty much the same living conditions, with some exceptions. This view that people not in USA/Europe are subhumans who cannot understand tech is quite biased and incorrect.

This is fact. this can be proven as it is right there. Of course I cannot guarantee what the future price will be, but anytime anybody has wanted to liquidate sharkfund0, I have accomodated.<br /><br />I am getting a bit tired of all this negativity in the NXT forum. i think I will take a vacation from it for a while.

But I would much prefer to see the MGW being something more like a 20 of 30 multisig, composed of trusted entities. 2 of 3 is just way to small and easy to collude or hack.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Are you willing to pay large transaction fees to pay for 30 operators to all run servers with MGW+Nxt+all the coin wallets on them? How do you go about finding 30 trusted operators who will know enough to take care of server security? Each server will only take a certain amount of coin wallets before it runs out of RAM (unlikely to be able to fit more than 10 coins on one batch), so for each new batch of coins you want to support, you'll need another batch of operators or at least another batch of servers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That's a good point. Perhaps 20 of 30 is too high, but something like 5 of 10 may be more feasible. I'd be willing to pay a 0.0003 fee (triple the current) for this.

Let's focus on James. He is attracting so much capital and it needs to stop. I see red flags everywhere. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />James is different. His code is reviewed and tested. <br /><br />James actively answers questions here on the forums, suffering the slings and arrows of idiots and detractors. He also actively participates in discussions not related to his projects. <br /><br />James does not actively request donations.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That James his code for a certain project is reviewed and tested, or that he is helpful in discussions, does not change the fact that he is by far the top seller of assets, having received tens of millions of NXT from other people in return for mere promises. Even if he gives away control over the multigateway coins, if he turns out to be a fraud and all his assets go to zero like cointropolis, the NXT asset exchange, and NXT in general, may take such a big reputation hit that an NXT competitor wins the race. So even if you do not invest in James his assets, we may all be seriously harmed.<br /><br />So my advice to anyone that invested a lot in James his assets is to lower your exposure, for your own sake and for NXT in general. Eventhough he claims otherwise, chances that his assets will outperform NXT in the long term are very low. Add to that the extra counterparty risk and you see that this is not such a great deal. So my advice is: make sure that if his assets would go down a lot in NXT value, that you still have enough NXT in your own possession.<br /><br /><br /><em>The best time to panic is generally before others do.<br /></em><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think you confuse market cap with NXT received. I dont have the exact total, but I think I have received &quot;only&quot; around 5 million NXT and that is for all my assets. For most of them only small portions were put up for sale, I am long term hodling around one third for most of them.<br /><br />What is your comment about sharkfund0, which seems somehow be 40% increase in a few months, with big liquidity for anybody. This is just what, imaginary? So no problem with advising caution, but please stick to the facts and do not accuse me of being some sort of fraud. I have published tens of thousands of lines of C code, is that a fraud? People have reviewed it. Are they saying it is horrible garbage code? <br /><br />Dont make yourself look silly. Stick to good advise and diversifying and reducing risk is good advice. If you try to make maximum ROI, you can easily end up losing money. I do not mind factual debate, but with you the facts seem very few. Now will all my automated businesses hit the high end of expectations? Maybe they will, maybe they wont. I am always working hard to improve any deficiency. For example, with NXTprivacy, I started with pNXT and a not fully decentralized solution. Some people provided valuable feedback and I kept improving it until it became the fully decentralized Teleport. So, maybe you can actually contribute, like eadqua. He was always negating my stuff, but then one day he started pushing an easy to use MGW and we now have MGW lite, which is quite handy for users.<br /><br />So, will you just spew nonsense or provide actual fact based posts?<br /><br />James

But I would much prefer to see the MGW being something more like a 20 of 30 multisig, composed of trusted entities. 2 of 3 is just way to small and easy to collude or hack.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Are you willing to pay large transaction fees to pay for 30 operators to all run servers with MGW+Nxt+all the coin wallets on them? How do you go about finding 30 trusted operators who will know enough to take care of server security? Each server will only take a certain amount of coin wallets before it runs out of RAM (unlikely to be able to fit more than 10 coins on one batch), so for each new batch of coins you want to support, you'll need another batch of operators or at least another batch of servers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That's a good point. Perhaps 20 of 30 is too high, but something like 5 of 10 may be more feasible. I'd be willing to pay a 0.0003 fee (triple the current) for this.
