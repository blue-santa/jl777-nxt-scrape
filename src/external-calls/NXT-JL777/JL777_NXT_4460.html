					Market's been pretty quiet<br />Did pick up a small amount via nxtltcn <br />You would think that gaining ~200BTC over several days is a nice 10% gain and it would be in terms of BTC, but with NXT continuing to rise against BTC, the net effect is a actually a slight loss in terms of NXT. This because NXT went up more than 10% and not all of the non-NXT sharkfund0 holdings went up as much as NXT.<br /><br />Due to the significant non-NXT holdings, this volatility was expected. It is hurting the NXT based performance now, but when the trend reverses, it will do the opposite. It is like a boat riding up and down on the waves, its specific position at any given point and time needs to be balanced with the phase of the wave. So we need to find out the average position and as long as that is going up, we are OK.<br /><br />This means until we have a NXT downtrend, we wont be able to tell exactly where we are, and even then it will be an approximation.<br /><br />BTC value: ~2000 BTC<br />sharkfund0: 1993.3575 outstanding (10000 - 8'006.6425)<br />~0.99667875 BTC per sharkfund0<br />NXT @ .0001125 -&gt; 8859 NXT per sharkfund0<br /><br />New quote is 8800/8859<br /><br />James<br /><br />

Actually I believe that there should be some cooperation between centralized traditional exchanges and decentralized crypto exchanges. For example it's probably impossible to do HFT on blockchain (high frequency trading). But if you have some central access point in you can trade through it, and the distributed exchange is used for clearance (it's very sketchy but I hope you get the general idea)<br /><br />So there can appear some centralized platform giving access to all decentralized exchanges, like a tratidional broker provides access to various trading networks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>InstantDEX will allow for near realtime trading and it will use the blockchain to clear trades<br />The GUI will look and act like a centralized exchange, but it will be peer to peer<br />

					relevant info from another post:<br /><br />For MGW I decided not to use the user's key as there is no assurance that they will be around to sign a tx when needed. The multisig accts have the keys held by the three MGW servers. While each person gets his own multisig deposit address (for each supported coin), these addresses are actually used by MGW as pieces of the virtual wallet. There is no central wallet, but rather the sum of all the multisig accts.<br /><br />You might ask, how can MGW tell apart a user deposit from internal funds transfers. Yes, this was a problem,but I decided to charge a small fee on withdrawal and that fee creates a small output (currently equal to txfee) to flag whether an output is a user deposit or internal transfer. This solves an otherwise tricky problem and I can tell for sure if an unspent output is a user deposit or internal transfer.<br /><br />Every withdraw triggers an acct balancing via internal transfers. This way, all the multisig accts will converge to the average balance. Not only does that make it possible for a higher withdraw rate throughput, it also discourages hackers from bothering as it is a lot of work to break into multiple servers and then construct raw multisig transactions all with a time sensitive deadline as hundreds of nodes will be monitoring every blockchain event related to MGW<br /><br />So, you will be able to track the amount in your multisig acct, but the contents do not represent your balance, rather the amount of assets inside NXT AE represents your balance. I hope that makes sense.<br /><br />So MGW is not fully trustless, you have to trust that we will continue to operate the MGW. It uses 2 of 3 multisig so even if one server disappears without notice, we can always recreate new accts from the two remaining servers. As of now bithaus will be running one of the servers and I am still searching for the third host. Until we do, TEAM staff will be running the pair of MGW servers.<br /><br />The fee structure to begin with will be no cost for deposits other than the 1 NXT to generate the AM to request a deposit address. and two txfees for a withdraw. This is an introductory rate as MGW will be spending 1 NXT txfees on AMs and that cannot be sustained forever. If the txfee is reduced to 0.1 NXT, then maybe it wont be a big deal. So MGW will definitely be a big step up from centralized exchanges which either have a large central wallet or large cold storage wallets, either which can be compromised with a single intruder.<br /><br />MGW will be able to handle an arbitrary number of deposits as the deposits are just entries in the various blockchains and they are not moved at all and utilized in place. The withdraws are currently limited to ~1000 withdraws per day per coin, but this can be increased when there are enough accounts. <br /><br />The NXTservices that has the MGW client is running 99% the same software as the MGW server. So it can precisely monitor what the MGW servers are doing, including calculating the balances in all the accounts, monitoring pending deposits/withdraws, etc. I do not believe any centralized exchange has this level of visibility. Everyone will know that for each satoshi of BTC assets, there is a corresponding amount in unspent outputs in the sum of the multisig accts.<br /><br />James

That is the same problem with GOX.&nbsp; To use the system, I need a gateway and at any time that gateway can take all the money from all the customers and run.&nbsp; This is the Gox scenerio.&nbsp; Ripple is better than Gox though.&nbsp; When Gox goes down, it takes everyone's money for every kind of account.&nbsp; In Ripple if a gateway goes down, it just takes a very small part of the network down and everybody else is still safe.&nbsp; <br /><br />But what you guys are saying is that with multigateway on NXT is that I still own my keys?&nbsp; So that when I am using a BTC gateway or a LTC gateway, that gateway can't actually steal my money because they don't have all the keys to unlock it?&nbsp; The gateway can only actually get my key upon the moment of the trade?&nbsp; <br /><br />If this is true then it would mean that they gateway could indeed steal my money but it would be almost pointless and against the actions of a rational actor.&nbsp; A gateway could steal money from one or two transactions but then immediately word would get out and people would stop using that gateway.&nbsp; It is in the gateway's best interest to just process transaction fees and make more over the long haul, than run with any one person's transaction.&nbsp; The exception might be something like one person who tried to trade 10,000 BTC for 1,000.0000 LTC or something like that.&nbsp; This could be mitigated, I guess by insuring trades up to a certain amount and forcing that BTC whale to make 100 small 100 BTC trades.&nbsp; If they are happening every few seconds, then it would still just take a couple of minutes to trade the 10,000 BTC, though I think it would seriously hurt the exchange rate as the whale would be moving the market.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other way it seems like a person could lose their money is through a gateway terrorist attack.&nbsp; A competing network like Ripple or Ethereum could set up many gateways under false pretences.&nbsp; Once the gateway was popular, it would could have partner keys for lots and lots of accounts.&nbsp; It wouldn't be enough to unlock the money, but could having half of the keys and destroying them mean that the users of that gateway couldn't get their money out either???<br /><br />Of course this would be terribly harmful to a gateway, but if they gateway was created to be harmful, then it would serve its purpose.&nbsp; Is there anyway to stop this?&nbsp; Or is my scenario flawed? <br /><br />If this is what I think it is, a kind of Ripple where I own my keys to a gateway, then basically it is way better than Ripple, way better than Cryptsy, way better than anything out right now.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have been watching this for months.&nbsp; I was just wondering about this post on a different forum.&nbsp; It seems like NXT multi-gateway has to use keys.&nbsp; Ripple can process things like oil, dollars, euros, and gold.&nbsp; These things don't have keys.&nbsp; That would mean really NXT multi-gateway is not like Ripple, but more any exchange that only deals with coins.&nbsp; Is that right?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>multigateway is designed for bitcoind and its forks to go into and out of NXT AE. <br />NXT AE itself can do a lot of things and is the right thing to compare against ripple.<br /><br />For MGW I decided not to use the user's key as there is no assurance that they will be around to sign a tx when needed.

					<a href="http://209.126.71.170/NXTservices_v08b.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.71.170/NXTservices_v08b.zip</a> has the latest with NXTsync activated and hopefully working.<br /><br />The first step is to establish contact with another node using<br />/handle<br /><br />But before you can do that, you need to find out who is in your group with<br />?<br /><br />Your NXTsync chat handle is set to the name you have in the setaccountinfo, must be at least three chars long<br />You can change the group you start in by setting the setaccountinfo description with a &quot;group&quot;:&quot;&lt;initial group&gt;&quot; JSON entry. You can always change the group with:<br />#group<br /><br />So after you get the list you can make a &quot;punch&quot; request. This goes to the directory server who matches you up with the other side. Then some UDP magic happens and if all goes well after a command like &quot;/win7&quot; when in NXTsubatomic group you will see something like:<br /><br />fd.0 punch.initiate to (id:898207-7 win7/NXTsubatomic 54f976465a79acfb2fa00f4ca7f70e0fef18e7c219d89a0af060ac1a28a66766 initiate<br />) using server.(209.126.71.170)<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; got 103 bytes at 0x7f0988041750.(&lt;win7/NXTsubatomic 186.42.79.14:53518 8745ac0bfc74812a53f39add2ed02f5c722cab2592e44adadf3f817a8d64be5e)<br />grp.(NXTsubatomic) port.(53518) 53518 name.(win7)<br />pinged by (win7) ping_nr.1 crc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0/ n.0<br />&nbsp;return ping received: 423766016895692955 vs ping_nr.1 vs 1, (aa477ed1 aa477ed1) 209.126.71.170 | 1402722364382119<br />Round trip win7 219.000 ms [250.840] | Num_ipaddrs.2 Num_punch_servers.1<br /><br />punch.initiate starts the process and it contacts the directory server who contacted win7 which sent back its own punch request: &lt;win7/NXTsubatomic<br /><br />You will also see&nbsp; pinged by (win7)&nbsp; and &quot;return ping received&quot;, the first one is the other node pinging and that shows that you are receiving UDP directly from the other node! However, that is not enough, you also need to get the &quot;return ping received&quot; as that means that the other node got your ping and then returned it. Both all by UDP. The pings are the only things that are not encrypted. All other UDP comms are fully encrypted with a session based public/private key.<br /><br />current problem I see is that after the first connection to a win7 node, you have to punch twice to get the return ping. The first time works for me. Also, going to a Mac always seems to work. However, I am initiating from a server which behaves totally differently. I could not test non-server to non-server, which is what 99% of NXTsync will be so maybe this will be very flakey, not sure...<br /><br />Both sides can do the punching, but that just doubles the work. If one side gets things going it almost always works and you can just start typing into the command window. Only &quot;@&quot; and &quot;/&quot; and &quot;#&quot; are special characters, any other line is passed through. If you start the line with @win7, it is a private comm that only win7 sees. If there is no @handle, it goes out to the entire group. Yes, it is separately encrypted to each person in the group<br /><br />The following are the current commands<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;?&#039; to list online group members<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;#group to change group<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;/member&#039; to connect to &#039;member&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;/close member&#039; to close a conversation<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;/close&#039; to close all conversations<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;/rtt&#039; to toggle printing of round trip times<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;/help&#039; for this information<br /><br />So all this can be done from the command window, but with all the other printouts it is a bit of a mess. The most recent line should appear in the websockets page at the top.<br /><br />Almost forgot, I also implemented a primitive API for this<br /><br /><a href="http://127.0.0.1:7777/NXTservices" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:7777/NXTservices?</a>{&quot;chat&quot;:&quot;&lt;NXTsync chat line&gt;&quot;}<br />The above will do the same as typing in the command window and any supported chat command should work<br /><br />The above and the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7777/NXTservices" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:7777/NXTservices?</a>{&quot;oldsecret&quot;:&quot;&lt;old&gt;&quot;:&quot;newsecret&quot;:&quot;&lt;new&gt;&quot;} should allow the GUI to set the password to be the same as the normal GUI and also manage the chat, even changing groups. If you change to a new group that doesnt exist yet, a new one is made automatically.<br /><br />dont have error checking or even return results being sent back yet, but there should be plenty to test.<br />I am most interested in what percentage of nodes can be reached by each node. Every isp could have a different behavior and the UDP required some, well, not so standard things to be done.<br /><br />James<br />

Adding any bitcoind fork is more a matter of adding RAM to the servers, the software side is a matter of minutes. If the coin doesnt support multisig, like PPC and forks, not supported<br /><br />Since there is a very real server cost to adding a new coin, we would need to be sure it has enough volume to warrant it (or have the costs covered by subsidies). I think the approach of the large Chinese exchanges is the way to go, eg. few coins but very low fees. I would rather have large volumes from a small number of coins than a zillion garbage coins and maybe the same volume.<br /><br />James

					The backed up withdraws are getting cleared. I discovered a bug that all these withdraws exposed. With so little deposits, basically all the MGW funds ended up unconfirmed, so it was trying to do a withdraw with insufficient funds.<br /><br />I put in a check for that. I could try to fix this, but since it is only an issue when a big percentage of MGW deposits are withdrawn (&gt;10%?) I dont think it is a real world case. I am nervous about messing with this part of the code as I will have to make it use txouts that are not confirmed and then all of a sudden malleability becomes an issue and BTC hasnt fixed that yet.<br /><br />Now even if there is a single big acct, that doesnt help as the way silly bitcoin works is that you need to use the entire amount and send it back as change. Kind of unintuitive, to pay .0001 BTC to someone from a 100 BTC wallet you have to send the entire 100 BTC and give mass mass change of 99.9998 BTC<br /><br />Anyway, what MGW is supposed to do is spread all the BTC around so there are no big accts and no small accts. We need to verify this is the case and the only way to do it is to create a lot of accts and do a lot of withdraws. I think a test program will need to do this.<br /><br />Anyway, it is reprocessing and it has a chance to catch up. While I have been waiting for all the reprocessing I got NXTsync to work reliably via hundreds of trial and error tests. So, for ubuntu and Mac it seems pretty reliable. I will now test it under windows and if that works the next release will have a functional NXTsync and we can beat on that till it breaks too <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James

					This is great! Is it communicating with API?<br /><br />If so, can you push the password for the user&#039;s acct into NXTservices? That way there is no need to fiddle with a custom NXTservices acct, that was there just because we didnt have a GUI<br /><br />First do:<br /><a href="http://127.0.0.1:7777/NXTservices" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:7777/NXTservices?</a>{&quot;newsecret&quot;:&quot;&lt;gui acct password&gt;&quot;}<br /><br />This will return a bunch of info, most important is the &quot;secret&quot; field which is the acct secret for the NXTservices acct. You will need this to change to new acct<br /><br /><a href="http://127.0.0.1:7777/NXTservices" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:7777/NXTservices?</a>{&quot;oldsecret&quot;:&quot;&lt;secret from first call&gt;:&quot;,&quot;newsecret&quot;:&quot;&lt;gui acct password&gt;&quot;}<br /><br />Now NXTservices will use the same acct as the user put into the GUI<br />How long do you think this would take?<br /><br />James<br />

If adopted in the way we believe it should and there is good balance, NXT will see a skyrocketing in value per coin simply because it has to. If a new adopter wants to be able to use it, they have to buy NXT. There are a bunch of factors that will determine how this plays out, but I think we have good reason to be optimistic about the value of NXT long term. <br />&nbsp;<br />Optimized/strategic marketing will definitely play a critical role in getting NXT to become as well-known/adopted as BTC is, and eventually surpass that. Getting the sticky adoption in the very early stages and then building that momentum is incredibly important. But with so many sectors and areas to direct, you have to concentrate on one or two that are most likely to integrate, and from there, more and more sectors will want to join, once they see the benefits of using NXT. One of the great things BTC has going for it is that VCs are in love with its growth potential, and many of them are investing millions of dollars into it.<br /><br />When it comes to NXT, we need to develop a platform on which we can measure our success and failures. There are many many metrics that we can start tracking and using as benchmarks to measure our growth progress. Few examples-<br /><br />Number of all balances that had an voluntary outgoing transaction of NXT in the past 7 days- general measure of activity<br />Number of all &quot;monthly-active&quot; balances (balances that had a voluntary outoging transaction in the past 28 days) that were also active in the past week- shows us frequency of usage among the active userbase. <br />What % of balances that had a voluntary outgoing transaction in 28 to 21 days prior were active in the past week- measures retention and how often users come back.<br /><br />Each of these metrics can then be segmented into different cohorts, such as continent, balance size, sector, etc. Then we look through the trends and numbers and see which are the most promising areas, which areas are stagnant, which areas are strong, etc.<br /><br />This is just some of what I was thinking. If you want to discuss more via email or skype, let me know!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Fantastic. I would rather continue here so everyone can contribute, or at least watch. I like that Mr Big Data confirms my theory as there have been some skeptics who insist that NXT asset prices will deflate as NXT price rises. While some of this will happen, if the value isnt deflating, it has to be a temporary price discrepancy.<br /><br />The quickest thing that could use an expert to look at is an overal NXT market adoption metric. There is a lot of raw data, but I think buried in there is a metric that we can use to approximate the true value of NXT. Granted, there wont be an external anchor to price it in BTC or USD, but as long as it can be correlated to a reasonable widow of market prices, we might be able to extrapolate future prices based on this metric.<br /><br />The crypto prices tend to get pretty crazy and we can easily get convinced that event X is worth Y, but ultimately it is the adoption that creates value, so the markets estimate of various external events can be off by a significant margin.<br /><br />Once we get this metric(s), then we can concentrate on improving them without regard to the short term prices as that will create a lot more efficient use of resources.<br /><br />Did I get this right? I am new to Big Data<br /><br />James

And certainly this must be a major concern for any financial bigshot we&#039;re hoping to put millions into Nxt.<br /><br />More confusingly the Bitcoiners consider some kind of PoS (that apparently is no PoS... but that others say have &quot;nothing at stake&quot;). Sigh.<br /><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=584719.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=584719.0</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well clearly no PoS algo can possibly work unless the supergeniuses that made bitcoin make it <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />Oh, satoshi is no longer there...<br />Too bad for bitcoin, NXT had its own supergenius BCnext. <br /><br />Also, the NXT network was under constant attack in its early days. There was also the Dr.Evil attack based on malleability (found and fixed). And attacks are happening, but as you say no successful ones other than the Dr Evil attack have been found<br /><br />With NXT market cap you can be sure that attacks are happening all the time. So every day that goes by, the confidence level goes up.<br /><br />With the source code open and all the NXT haters of the world out there, if there was a fatal vulnerability in NXT (not just some theoretical PoS network) I would expect big headlines about it financed by the bitcoin guys.<br />I havent seen any such headlines.<br /><br />Absence of proof isnt proof of absence, but 6 months is a long time in crypto and a fatal flaw was already found and fixed and people tried but couldnt find any other. With NXT stature rising, it will be a matter of time until someone like Bernstein will analyze NXT algo and either find weaknesses for us to fix or prove that it is sound.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just thought of something...<br /><br />We could fund a special bounty for attackers to find holes in our security. Fund it in bitcoin, so the attack cannot have impact on the value of the bounty.<br /><br />That says: &quot;We're so confident about our security that we'll pay you to prove us wrong !&quot;<br /><br />It's been done before by some companies.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wasn't that basically what was done in the beginning (except paid in Nxt)?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>yes, a lot of people tried to find flaws, only Dr Evil found one that wasnt injected<br /><br />I am sure it would be possible to put together a bounty, but I am trying to get Bernstein to review NXT. I think that would have a lot more weight than random guys trying to get a bounty. We already have random guys trying to hack accts.<br /><br />If someone like Bernstein can either prove NXT is 100% secure or has xyz vulnerabilities, we are much better off as we can address the xyz issues if they exist.<br /><br />James

My job consists of aggregating and analyzing data to make insights that help make a product (or company) function better. I've been the head data analyst for various projects in sales, marketing, engineering, product, and infrastructure. <br /><br />By chance, I stumbled upon the NXT forums recently and really liked what I saw. I've always been very interested in crypto-currencies and many what I've read about NXT just resonates really strongly with what I think a growing crypto community should be like.<br /><br />First, I think it's incredibly cool that NXT has a whole range of possible uses that is not just limited to money transferring. This flexibility of different applications is what sets it apart from a lot other coins, especially a lot of the coins that are essentially just bitcoin clones.<br /><br />In addition, I love that a lot of people here on this forum are really invested in the long term vision, as opposed to of the &quot;pump and dump&quot; mentality that are sometimes on the other crypto-c forums. <br />I'll keep this part short but those are two of the main reasons why NXT appeals to me so much.<br /><br />I firmly believe that cryptocurrency technology will play an important role in our economy and lives in the decades to come, and I think NXT is one of the most promising developments that I've seen in the area.<br /><br />I would love to directly help in the efforts of taking NXT to the next level. I have witnessed how powerful data analytics can be when applied to various products; in fact, being data-driven and being able to pivot and adapt fast is one of the key advantages for many SF tech startups nowadays. <br /><br />I'm currently brainstorming ideas and if any of you all have any thoughts on how we can use data analysis to improve NXT, let's have a chat! I'm really open to anything, such as side projects, research, or even building dashboards/tools/platforms with developers/data engineers, as long as it provides good value!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Cool skillset!<br />Do you do Big Data?<br /><br />My goal is to help 1% of GDP to move to NXT economy before the end of the decade. Otherwise I have to eat my hat so I am hoping you can help by identifying the biggest sectors that are ready to move to crypto so we can prioritize the targeted marketing to the most effective areas.<br /><br />I have a theory about the impact of asset values on NXT:<br /><a href="https://nxtforum.org/asset-exchange-general/total-market-capitalisation-of-all-assets/msg42562/#msg42562" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/asset-exchange-general/total-market-capitalisation-of-all-assets/msg42562/#msg42562</a><br /><br />I found out this was actually some standard economic theory stuff, I just tried to foresee what will happen. So, if I am right the sooner we can get high value assets into NXT, the better.<br /><br />James
