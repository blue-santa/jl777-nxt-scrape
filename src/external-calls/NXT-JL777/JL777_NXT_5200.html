Now I wish that I had given more decimals to NXTautoDAC. In the future I will issue assets with some decimals. The dividend calculation will be 1 NXTautoDAC asset for every 4 NXTventure assets you hold. I have not decided what to do yet with the accts that dont have a multiple of 4 assets. After this dividend there will be a small amount of NXTautoDAC left inside NXTventure. These assets will be sold on the open market for working capital or held for long term appreciation.<br /><br />I expect the actual dividends to go out in very early June<br /><br />James

					I have decided to merge most of my personal external crypto accts into sharkfund0<br /><br />The current portfolios of my bter, cryptsy and poloniex accts will be swapped for the market value amount of sharkfund0. I will keep the small DGEX acct separate, plus my cold storage 15000 DRK and 12000 XCP as I was going to run some DRK masternodes and I never figured out how to get the burned XCP out and I did borrow a lot of money and will use the cold storage to pay that off. Just waiting for USD collapse to pay back with super inflated dollars.<br /><br />I dont want to sell off NXT to get the BTC needed for trading and this also solves that issue<br /><br />I have received BTC deposits of 100.835 BTC which have already been exchanged for sharkfund at the then current exchange rates. this was deposited into BTER which has a total value of 144.6694 BTC<br /><br />Poloniex (after overnight ~20 BTC gain on MRO) has 83.884 BTC<br />Cryptsy has 96.439 BTC<br /><br />This has a net of 224.1574 BTC. After looking at all the MRO trades, it seems I had spent about 5 BTC encouraging the market, so lets call it 15 BTC from &quot;night trading&quot; MRO, so sharkfund0 investors have gained around 1.5% from my quick in and out trades of MRO. Can you tell when I purchased and sold MRO? <a href="https://www.poloniex.com/exchange/btc_mro" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.poloniex.com/exchange/btc_mro</a><br /><br />I must have gotten lucky and got rewarded with a gold coin <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />that is 209.1574 BTC which at current exchange rate of .00008 = 2801967.5 NXT, so divide by 10000 to get sharkfund0 units. txid 3381162086843878130<br /><br /><a href="http://209.126.71.170/sharkxfer.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.71.170/sharkxfer.zip</a> has images of the balance pages for the accts being transferred<br /><br />I hope this lives up to the level of transparency that is expected. You dont know my blood type, but you now know the exact balances in my trading accts.<br /><br />Until pandaisftw&#039;s realtime acct balance display is working, I will post the latest balances on a somewhat irregular basis. I will continue to trade these three accts with the same level of care and thought that has gotten them to this level.<br /><br />The 1.5% gain isnt much, I know, but the shark is still sleeping <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />Now that it has 325 BTC of liquid crypto, it is liable to make unexpectedly quick bites, when it sees something tasty<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. If you have some idle BTC, it is the preferred method of getting sharkfund0, I dont want to have to sell the NXT, that is my one bias and makes it so I cant effectively trade NXT.

					I applied for the baby sharks position <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />I think I did pretty good. accumulated 1% of MRO at ~.004 and cashed out with 50% profit<br />I figured a 20 BTC gain while I slept was pretty good. Not convinced of MRO long term viability yet<br /><br />pandaisftw is almost done with first version of automated exchange balance reporting<br />and I need to properly account for the transfer of my personal accts into the sharkfund accts<br />even though it wasnt officially part of the sharkfund yet, I will toss the 20BTC gain I made into the NXTsharks profit column<br /><br />I think that puts us up ~2% so far<br /><br />James

I have paid dozens of BTC for its development from my personal funds. I don't feel it has benefited me nearly as much. Whether it's part of my business model, you can say it is or you can say it isn't, both are right depending on who thinks and what he thinks. It isn't a black or white. However my experience with nextcoin.org taught me an excellent lesson: a prominent business operator can not be considered a genuine community figure, seldom even a benefactor, no matter what he does. There's just nothing you can do about that, because earning money and working for free are contrary to each other, and working for free is tightly associated to community effort in people's mind.<br /><br />As for DGEX IPO being successful, yes indeed it was. However, although the 10+ Million NXT from sale sales are in my custody, they remain unrealized for quite a while and practically they're not mine until I'm no longer morally liable to the shareholders. Meanwhile, they're under clear and present threat of just vanishing one fine day, either through some kind of hacking or an incident that would force me to compensate DGEX customers. Sitting on such a hot pile isn't a nice job you know. I feel I fully deserve whatever will remain once I'm out.<br /><br />If Offspring is awarded a bounty, I will give it to Dirk who has done all the hard work.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If we think of this as bounty to Dirk instead of bounty to DGEX, the answer is very clear isnt it?<br />Offspring was the first wallet that implemented bitcoin style wallet and stopped the FUD about NXT brainwallet being so hard to use.<br />That alone is worth the bounty in my mind, plus I hear it is pretty easy to use and a nice intro wallet<br />as long as it is open source, not sure what the issue is

Is it network security, or the whole unfairness thing?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It's a good question. For me it's about power.<br />I appreciate your work, I supported you too with some NXT, and that's all fine. But in the end it comes down to the question if we want benevolent dictators. I am on philosophical/political grounds against that. And history shows that it never works out.<br /><br />There are some quite interesting discussions when back in the early days of anarchism and socialism. There was the question: Should the socialist revolution be done by a powerful elite. Because that seemed like the only way it would ever happen (de-centralized is tough as we all know).<br />&nbsp;<br />Bakunin (one of the founders of anarchism) criticized that idea and Marxism. He said that a proper society will never come from benevolent dictators - like Lenin tried to be. And despite Bakunin not even being alive when the revolution started he was eerily spot on with his predictions. <br /><br />I know that's quite an arch here, but to me it applies. Crypto's started out because of anarchistic ideals. That's why I want to see bitcoin succeed. And that's why I think NXT is even better.<br />But 70 stake-holders can do massive actions and decisions that influence all of us. What if someone dumps 50 million NXT right now into an exchange? The stake-holders can crush all of the community's work. That is a lot of power - just gained by being first in some forum.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">So now I have control of one of the bigger accts. Is this a good thing or bad thing?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It's good for now. Inevitable maybe, since an IPO was just what had to happen for NXT.<br />But we cannot accept it as status quo in the long run. This has to change.<br /><br />Should NXT become a standard currency worldwide, then the top owners have even more power - with this amount of wealth it would would leech into all areas of life. <br />It would likely be a 100 western-educated-geeky people owning this wealth and power. That's likely even worse than the current wealth and power distribution in the world - and not representative of the worlds population.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I have already distributed the majority of TEAM assets, so now there are 20 TEAM members and dozens of investors who are represented by the amount TEAM controls. Kind of like a leased forging pool from a different angle<br />As other NXT companies form, this pattern will repeat and create further and further fragmentation of NXT &quot;control&quot;<br />All these fears about big whale causing problems are natural,but if they did make a big dump I assure you there are patient investors ready for this to happen. It would just cause more distribution<br />There is always that self-interest thing. The larger ones stake in NXT is, the less likely you will take any chances.<br /><br />Proof of Stake for all is faults is so much better than Proof of Work. I dont think we have to run faster than the bear, we just need to run faster than PoW.<br /><br />

I'm wondering if there's a way to find out, for example, how many accounts have over 1million Nxt, or 50,000, or whatever. A way to do some statistical research. If not, what sources are those charts even based on?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Its all there on the blockchain.<br />You just need to get a list of all active accounts and then do a getAccount API call<br />extract the amount of NXT and sort<br /><br />that gets you a snapshop.<br />However a much more interesting thing would be to create a NXT flow graph. All NXT flows backwards in time to the genesis block. So in essence all of NXT would &quot;belong&quot; to the genesis account.<br /><br />Go one generation forward. Now we have 73 accts. It is a bit more complicated as some NXT is definitely exchanged between these original accts, some even back to genesis, so now we have &quot;fuzzy&quot; belonging to the 73 accts. You can trace the NXT in your acct all the way back to one (or more) of the original 73 accts<br /><br />Clearly that doesnt mean that you are a drone of one of the 73 accts, but some accts could very well be.<br /><br />What you can do is create a cluster analysis (not sure if this is actual mathematical field, i would think it is maybe different name) to identify higher than expected frequency of interaction between two accts. Lets call these related accts. Now they could be related because it is controlled by the same person, or maybe it is a client/vendor relationship.<br /><br />You can also see correlations in payment destinations. Maybe the same person or maybe a group of people that cooperate.<br /><br />So, we are fully in the realm of probabilities. No more clean 64 bit integers, but messy disgusting floating point is required. Each transaction changes the probability distribution of one more accts and updates the likelihood that they are controlled by the same entity.<br /><br />As time goes on the fuzzy borders will get clearer and clearer and you will be able to chart three dimensional spheres of correlation with cool gradient colors between the spheres<br /><br />Is that something like what you wanted?<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Thats just what I saw when I visualized your question. To get an analysis like that you would need to ask your govt, they are doing exactly this and a lot more. In fact they are associating each sphere with a verified name and they wont stop until they map all the crypto accts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, that definitely answers my question, even if parts of it make about as much sense to me as an ancient Etruscan inscription&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /> Also interesting to learn that you're a visual thinker!<br /><br />Your point about gov't spooks raises some intriguing questions. Sometimes it seems to me that many governments are becoming more favorable towards cryptocurrencies and are beginning to support their mainstream use rather than trying to stamp them out. I wonder if this might be in part because cryptos offer certain possibilities of surveillance that aren't as feasible with fiat. Fiat is managed by banks which can maintain a degree of privacy for their clients, while cryptos are right out there in the public view. But this leads away from the thread's topic of distribution&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You have realized an unfortunate truth.<br />The spook agencies are totally happy with crypto, it is an unimaginably easier way to track the money than ever before. When you have access to physical surveillance, magical radio devices that work on computers that are powered down and not connected to the internet, realtime global imaging at crazy good resolution in both visual and infrared spectrums, not to mention literal supercomputers and more storage you can imagine, and a large staff of highly paid intelligent operatives, and all their &quot;assets&quot; (informants)<br /><br />well you get the picture. Anybody they want info on, they already have it. Nothing you can do to stop it.<br /><br />It is the &quot;normal&quot; agencies like the tax agency that was behind the times. I think they finally begged enough and got the nice colored spheres program from their big brother agency. I estimate they have over half the BTC wallets correlated with high probability to specific taxpayers. Once this reaches 90%, the &quot;war on bitcoin&quot; will magically end and BTC prices will be allowed to go up again. See, they need to make sure they can collect taxes on the gains!<br /><br />I think its as simple as that. They can ignore a few hundred million of &quot;lost&quot; tax revenues, but when it becomes billions and billions, they put the brakes on.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. here come the black helicopters again <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

Haven't smite anyone ever (is that like the book of Santa with good and bad?&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /> )<br /><br />It's patatos vs. potatos if the number of accounts (with the same amount of NXT) stays the same, but with different people.<br />And if they are, as you say &quot;sharks&quot; than we are in for one hell of a ride.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It will be a roller coaster that is for sure.<br />This is true of all markets, but especially for crypto<br />Anyway, not sure what the concern is. Is it network security, or the whole unfairness thing?<br />At first I felt it was unfair, but I decided the world was unfair, maybe the NXT world was less unfair, so I joined the community by starting doing some tech support in the mega thread. <br /><br />Then amazingly I started getting support, actual NXT being deposited in my acct. No committment or obligation, just NXT being given to me. This does not happen in the real world. I had some personal financial issues, but I kept putting time in and I kept getting support. Less than six months later I have been able to earn enough NXT to get me the stake that I had hoped I had. NXT is a meritocracy much more than the real world, which is based on inherited wealth and political power more than anything else. This nature of NXT is why I am confident in the future. The other cryptos have way too much structure to ever be a pure meritocracy<br /><br />So now I have control of one of the bigger accts. Is this a good thing or bad thing? Maybe I will convince 47...88 to join me in my evil schemes to steal peoples forging revenues. Ah, still need to find about 10 more guys to get to the 51% mark. So it will take a while to find them and then convince them that it is worth losing millions of NXT, because we just have to get every single NXT that is being forged. <br /><br />Huh? Now I am not the smartest guy around, by a long shot, but I am smart enough to know that if you have millions of NXT, doing anything to jeopardize the network for the paltry forging revenues is totally idiotic. As NXT goes to the &quot;new money&quot; crowd who work hard and earn it, more and more NXT will end up in the hands of people who have spent enormous effort (or lots of actual BTC) to acquire it. Thus even if the average top acct stays the same, this distribution from &quot;old money&quot; to &quot;new money&quot; is valuable distribution.<br /><br />At least I think it is very valuable<br /><br />James

What if I want to know how much Nxt is in the 250'th biggest account? The very existence of those charts shows this info is available, I'm just wondering how they get the info to make the charts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It is difficult to follow the distribution of Nxt from the original holders to the current ones, but it would be very useful to dispel one of the most damaging perceptions showing that the community is getting more diversified.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That has nothing to do with my question. I'm wondering if there's a way to find out, for example, how many accounts have over 1million Nxt, or 50,000, or whatever. A way to do some statistical research. If not, what sources are those charts even based on?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Its all there on the blockchain.<br />You just need to get a list of all active accounts and then do a getAccount API call<br />extract the amount of NXT and sort<br /><br />that gets you a snapshop.<br />However a much more interesting thing would be to create a NXT flow graph. All NXT flows backwards in time to the genesis block. So in essence all of NXT would &quot;belong&quot; to the genesis account.<br /><br />Go one generation forward. Now we have 73 accts. It is a bit more complicated as some NXT is definitely exchanged between these original accts, some even back to genesis, so now we have &quot;fuzzy&quot; belonging to the 73 accts. You can trace the NXT in your acct all the way back to one (or more) of the original 73 accts<br /><br />Clearly that doesnt mean that you are a drone of one of the 73 accts, but some accts could very well be.<br /><br />What you can do is create a cluster analysis (not sure if this is actual mathematical field, i would think it is maybe different name) to identify higher than expected frequency of interaction between two accts. Lets call these related accts. Now they could be related because it is controlled by the same person, or maybe it is a client/vendor relationship.<br /><br />You can also see correlations in payment destinations. Maybe the same person or maybe a group of people that cooperate.<br /><br />So, we are fully in the realm of probabilities. No more clean 64 bit integers, but messy disgusting floating point is required. Each transaction changes the probability distribution of one more accts and updates the likelihood that they are controlled by the same entity.<br /><br />As time goes on the fuzzy borders will get clearer and clearer and you will be able to chart three dimensional spheres of correlation with cool gradient colors between the spheres<br /><br />Is that something like what you wanted?<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Thats just what I saw when I visualized your question. To get an analysis like that you would need to ask your govt, they are doing exactly this and a lot more. In fact they are associating each sphere with a verified name and they wont stop until they map all the crypto accts.

If so, maybe its not a libcurl problem.
