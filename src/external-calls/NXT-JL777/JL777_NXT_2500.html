I am saying what I need to be able to select NXT as the platform for my supernetwork that will be used by BTCD and already several other top 50 coins are expressing interest. I imagine that if I do not find a satisfatory outcome, then a lot of other businesses will come to the same conclusion.<br /><br />I need this fixed. and fixed now. Not with some talk, but a commitment to allow the NXT businesses that are the ones that deal with this to have the authority to declare a release Stable and to set the future block when things hardfork. If the devs can make releases that is backward compatible and not hardforking then there is no debate, it just happens like now.<br /><br />However who can actually verify that a new release doesnt break the NXT businesses software? If you can figure out how the NXT core devs or some NXT Organization can figure this out, then please tell me. To my knowledge only the NXT businesses that made and maintain the software are able to best estimate what the impact is on their systems, project schedules, etc.<br /><br />

It's probably both reasons, but what is the major one? Could it really be the pub key requirement that slows down new signups? <br /><br />I mean, if an investor is seriously considering NXT, then learning to enter a pub key at an exchange is only a five minute task in the entire rather longish process of learning NXT. Then again, maybe I am overestimating people's learning abilities? Yeah, I understand some merchants' software is broken, but major exchanges have already got the pub key requirement right.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I would have to look at the raw data to estimate, but all we have to do is see the daily new accts before and after block 215000

Where were all the versions that allowed the forgers to decide about this issue? So the whole &quot;forgers decide&quot; sounds nice, but what that really means is that the devs decide when it is ready to be released.<br /><br />James

He's not someone you can just replace.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am not threatening to leave, I will still develop for NXT, but I might be forced to select some other 2.0 crypto platform for the supernetwork. I cannot put my reputation on the line to convince a top 50 coin to put Nxt Inside and then have it break monthly. That is DOA, no go, cant do it. I can put up with this nonsense for my own projects, but I cannot subject other top coins to it.<br /><br />So, if NXT does not separate the release approval and timing of these hardforks breaking of existing software to the NXT businesses (or any other NXT constituency), then I will not be able to use NXT for the supernetwork, you know the NxtInside possibly dozens of coins. It will end up being TBDInside.<br /><br />It is standard for the release approval to be done by a different group than the one that develops it. Only when a project is small and there is really no other independent group do you do things the way NXT is doing. NXT now has this vested independent group called the NXT businesses. The dont have the big NXT stakes, but they have invested time, money, skills, creativity into creating a NXT based business. It is my opinion that these NXT businesses should have the authority to declare what is and isnt the official Stable release. Now if the devs can make releases that dont break any existing NXT API and doesnt hardfork, then they can keep making release after release like they have been.<br /><br /><br />James<br />

And then it is only called the official release when the NXT businesses approve it as stable, or if there is no feedback for X amount of time, it is assumed to be stable so inaction by the NXT businesses is the same as approval.<br /><br />Really, that's all that it would take. For this 1.2.5 fiasco, if I had any ability to say, wait! I need more time and get MGW fixed and then other websites could all verify it all works then when there are no significant objections (I ignore how to classify something as significant or not), the GUI and websites are updated with a Stable release<br /><br />Something must be done, and soon<br /><br />James

I do not want some horrible red tape BIP garbage and total paralysis. I want X to make just as much fast progress, but knowing that they cannot just say, it's done and will go live in 2000 blocks! X can make all the changes it wants, Y will find whatever issues there are and Z determines the timing of the official release and maybe even changes in actual features if it is deemed to cause too much problems.<br /><br />We all want NXT to get to the next level.<br />Without this, NXT is losing many existing businesses.<br /><br />James

Nxt is the best but nobody cares anymore? It is really tough to keep optimistic these days.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Many people are trading via MGW and a lot of people don't trust Bter anymore.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />MGW got a big dump too I just noticed recently. The bids for NXT on MGW is much lower than Bter even. Oh well what can you do.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also, I think we have to take into account who the traders and investors are now. Only Bitcoin, Litecoin, and (shudder) Dogecoin can be used to actually do things. There are a few other coins that are accepted in online and brick-and-mortar stores or for services, but all cryptocurrencies are still in the speculative phase. Many speculators are not buy-and-hodl types; they want to see their investments pay off quickly. Put another way, most people are not able to sit and do nothing; they want action. They don't see a lot of price action in Nxt, so they go where there's a show. Take a look at what happened with BitsharesX, for example. How many speculators took a good, hard look at the whitepaper, the developers, the community, and the coin code and bought for sound technical and financial reasons? Most just jumped on the momentum.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Actually, NXT investors are the best hodler's in all of crypto. Through all the ups and downs the vast majority of NXT'ers are NXT hodlers.<br /><br />However recent ivory tower callous attitude by the NXT core devs has not only make a lot of extra work, delayed releases, lost customers and revenues for all the businesses that use NXT. There has been no public acknowledgement that a problem even exists<br /><br />Now it is common for a rapidly developing tech project to not realize that other people are actually using it. NXT is a victim of its own success. Now there have been two things done with the same release and despite warnings from many, including myself, nothing was done. I was certainly offended, but I have 175+ million NXT worth of assets that I am essentially CEO for and I believe that makes me the largest NXT net worth guy, who also has written more code for NXT API than anybody else.<br /><br />Still, my advice is ignored. Maybe I am just a simple C programmer and not smart enough to do Java core stuff. OK, so I am second class citizen, but I am somewhat skilled at creating and running businesses (and turns out even a coin!), so it is probably a good idea to not just do the ostrich thing.<br /><br />I dont want to be making some sort of power play, but in a decentralized NXT there is not anyone with power that comes close to the NXTcore devs to make them STOP THE INSANITY. I just want to be able to use NXT as the 2.0 crypto platform for the BTCD supernetwork. However, lacking a formal commitment to a sane release process and schedule, I am forced to look for a 2.0 crypto platform that will make such a commitment.<br /><br />The majority of my net worth is in NXT assets and I must do what is best for them. My sincere hope is that NXT coredevs will make it clear to me and to the rest of the world that it is serious about being a platform. There is too much power concentrated in the NXT core devs, it is time to create some balance and a NXT business-centric group to signoff on ANY release that changes API or hardforks.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I do not want to have any position in this NXT business-centric group other than to get it started. I have no interest in whatever &quot;power&quot; is wielded by this group. It should be composed of representatives such as bter, coinomat, dgex, mynxtinfo, nxtreporting, etc. etc. You know all the websites we love to use that make NXT what it is. Those are the people that should have the ability to determine API compatibility and hardfork releases.

If there is ever another such update that is made that breaks installed base without consultation or approval from the NXT business community, I will be forced to recommend to not update to the new version until whatever issues are fixed.<br /><br />I cannot be spending time, effort and my reputation to convince other coins to put Nxt Inside, only for NXT core devs to say they just have to make a new release each time NXT does. Maybe this is a way for NXT core devs to say they dont want to support Nxt Inside effort. If that is the case, they should just say so and I will be forced to choose a different 2.0 platform currency.<br /><br />What do you think that would do to NXT?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />if you leave and go somewhere else, why not start here:&nbsp; <a href="https://stellartalk.org/topic/4629-is-anyone-making-a-trading-client/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://stellartalk.org/topic/4629-is-anyone-making-a-trading-client/</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am not talking about leaving, i am talking about selecting a crypto 2.0 platform to use for the supernetwork<br />I really, really want to use NXT, but unless there is commitment and clarity to not ever do this type of forced change on the business community that uses NXT, there seems to be only two choices:<br /><br />1. Have a specific stable version that the NXT businesses agree is the current version, regardless of what version is actually released. The problem with this is that it will most likely case a fork and the network will split leading to, I have no idea what happens if some significant percentage just refuses to upgrade to a new hardforking version. Probably not a good result.<br /><br />so to avoid damage to the NXT network, I would be forced to go with:<br /><br />2. select some other crypto (NEM?) to use for the supernetwork. This will make the people that dont like the idea of NxtInside happy, but it means a lot of extra work for me, so I am not liking it so much, not to mention the loss of the marketcap gains NXT would get from being the crypto 2.0 platform for the supernetwork<br /><br />I much prefer:<br /><br />3. NXT core devs consult with and LISTEN to feedback from NXT businesses that are depending on NXT for their income and put in whatever is needed for backward compatibility or even delay new features if backward compatibility is not possible. Then after there is a way to add the new features with minimal issues, as determined by the people affected by the issues, the update is made with enough time for a full project management cycle, regardless of how easy the NXT core devs feel the change should be for the people who are doing the changes.<br /><br />What good is having a zillion features if each time we add them, we lost 30% of the installed base and slow down adoption. isnt the point to grow NXT usage rather than to add as many features as possible?<br /><br />I also suggest a maximum of four hardforks per year, that's one every three months at MOST! Preferably not more than 2 per year<br /><br />James
