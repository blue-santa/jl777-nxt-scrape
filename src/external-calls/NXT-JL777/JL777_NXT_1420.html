I was content to let NXTpoker do its own thing, but when the head of NXT organization is making biased statements against Pangea (based on the first internal dev version of GUI), I decided I should make my position known. It is one thing for NXTpoker to say such things about Pangea, but for a supposedly fair head of NXT organization to be making statements harmful to Pangea assetholders, this is not a behavior that is correct.<br /><br />I will go silent now, unless Pangea is unfairly attacked again<br /><br />James<br />

Everybody keeps on saying that I shouldn't use the phone or internet or cars because they can be used for bad, like once somehow something is used for bad then I somehow don't want to use it.&nbsp; I didn't ever say that.&nbsp; I don't want cars, or phones, or trains shut down just because they have been used for something bad.&nbsp; Likewise I don't want this market shut down so I wish people would stop making that correlation that is off point.&nbsp; I want this market to be up, even if it does get used for something bad.

Then what do you do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br />I spoke to this many times.&nbsp; I said that if NXT gets big enough that a simple filter wouldn't work.&nbsp; If/when the NXT marketplace gets big enough and if/when a simple filter fails to prevent bad actors from taking root, then at that point instead of playing whack-a-mole, then the community should come together and have a different discussion taking into consideration the new events. <br /><br />Again, I am just asking, &quot;Basically, how well do you think a filter of the known top obvious words would be as a temporary stop-gap measure?&nbsp; If it would work as a temporary stop-gap to prevent/delay things from taking root here, would the effort of putting it in the code justify the time it buys NXT?&quot;<br /><br />There is no need to get off tract about the definition of &quot;tacit&quot; or what planes and phones can be used for, or whether I care about NXT, or that such a suggestion shouldn't be implemented because somehow it is not a 100% solution.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First off, FreeMarket is running on top of NXT, so it is not really something for the NXT core to be dealing with. Anything could have been stored in AM for almost a year now. The FreeMarket is storing info in the blockchain, so for NXT core to be filtering, it would need to be filtering the AM in the blockchain.<br /><br />This would cause some potential problems, beyond any hard forking, but I am assuming you want to have FreeMarket add filters centrally and not the NXT core. The problem is of course, this wont stop or even delay anybody that wants to do it. You can put CP into the BTC blockchain too, so I really dont see this as depending on the capability.<br /><br />Since this is something built on top of NXT, I dont see why you think NXT is at risk. As long as FreeMarket isnt actively catering to illegal markets, I dont see how it should be deemed responsible either. It is like an email client or web publishing tool, eg. it allows people to create the content but isnt responsible for the content produced.<br /><br />I think the proper way to think about this is that the people (if any) that use FreeMarket (or NXT or BTC) for illegal purposes will be prosecuted, but that platform itself is neutral.<br /><br />DGS is also a marketplace, not sure why you arent all worried about that, but the same concepts apply. keyword filter wont have any effect. I think the solution is to pursue actual offenders, instead of coming up with theoretical cases in the absence of any actual crimes. The only filtering that I see that has a chance of actually working is one that is continually monitored by people, but we have the police for that dont we? Do you suggest that NXT (or FreeMarket) become the police?<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. In all uses of DGS or FreeMarket, the tech doesnt actually deliver the products, so it seems to me that they would be more along the lines of free speech and that any crime is happening when the product is actually sent. Is it illegal to talk about something? Maybe it is, not sure.

Maybe you can prove it isnt, but why not use something that cant be controlled at all by the contestants?<br /><br />I think having T spots that correspond to the total NXT coming in is ok. However, to be fair, the random number used to determine the winner should be 0 mod T to avoid biasing the earlier entries, unless you want to give preference to the early entries. With a large 64 bit number, it wont really matter much as it is diluted, but the smaller the random number is, the bigger this effect.<br /><br />For an extreme case, lets assuming random number is up to 20 and you have 18 spots. then R mod 18 would have a very large bias in favor of spots 0 and 1<br /><br />Not sure why you dont just do a SHA256(most recent N blockhash) mod T<br />where the SHA256 can be truncated to the least significant 64bits so you can use 64 bit math<br />just concatenate N blockhashes and take SHA256 of it. With a cutoff at a certain blockheight. Each new block coming in will change the outcome and only the one that forges the latest block can experiment until it has the right value, but I think we can assume this is a small risk.<br /><br />If you want to make it immune to even that, then also use the blockhash of the BTC block that comes in after the critical blockheight to make it so both the BTC miner and NXT forger have to cooperate.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Depending on when you need your random number, you might be able to just use the SuperNET provably random number API that I am working on

If 99 murderers go free to allow 1 innocent man to not be executed, is that a good tradeoff? Does that mean that someone that supports policies that make it difficult to execute someone is supporting murder? Alternatively, does it mean that someone that doesnt support these policies is in favor of executing innocent people? <br /><br />I dont think either conclusion is correct. Do you? Now, using this false logic, you can start screaming that someone is either in support of murderers or that they support executing innocent people, depending on their answer. So, how can it be that no matter what you answer that you are a murderer supporter or supporter of executing innocent people.<br /><br />James
