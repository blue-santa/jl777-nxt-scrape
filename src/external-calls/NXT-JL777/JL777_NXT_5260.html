					DRK ratio at 185<br />So it seems safe to conclude that 100 have flipped from being the ceiling to being the floor.<br />Now the question is has the recent NXT surge changed the 250 ceiling<br />my guess (and that is all you can do until a pattern emerges) is that we will see resistance around 200:1 <br />If DRK can breakthrough and shoot past 250:1, well anything can happen<br /><br />James

I expect I can go back to the more typical 90% coding ratio<br />I volunteered to help sephr with his dividending, thinking that it would be a simple task. I also though it would be a nice piece of the puzzle to have and an easy project to get back into coding mode.<br /><br />Unexpectedly the current AE API is missing a few things that would have made it easy, so I am having to construct a fairly large amount of code to essentially generate a set of AE trades to add to each block's transactions. Anyway, this is something all asset owners will need and I am not sure when it will be part of the NXT core.<br /><br />So, I will push on and complete this and make it part of NXTservices_v04, dividending is an important part of AE functionality, even if only a few people have to use it, all of NXT benefits.<br /><br />James<br /><br />

NXTBank is issued all the shares of the new venture in exchange for the loan. The borrower can then buy back the shares in their company from NXTBank with a predetermined amount of interest??<br /><br />the incentive to pay the loan back comes from the borrower wanting ownership of their company free and clear, to own or to issue assets on their own for their real market value. if the borrower defaults, NXTBank would at least be left with ownership of the new company <br /><br />spaw<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I like this! Very creative idea and I am glad to see others push the boundaries. We are in a totally new sphere so we can design things that were not possible before.<br /><br />This asset sellback is perfect for a startup business oriented loan. Certainly any successful business would be worth far more than any principal+interest that would be required to repurchase the assets.<br />However, I do not want people to think that they can just shoot for the moon and if it doesnt work out, they just walk away. They are still honor bound to pay back the loan and this is simply a mechanism to enforce it.<br /><br />borrowers selfinterest guarantees loan repayment. That is the brilliance of this idea<br />borrowers honor will hopefully serve as the backstop in case the business doesnt work out<br /><br />Now as to trust level. Lets give an example. Lets say CfB needed a loan for whatever reason. I would imagine that a lot of people would just lend him money without interest, but lets say a loan arrangement is made at an interest rate. Then I believe repayment is much more assured than if the loan was made to someone with all the right paperworks.<br /><br />I tend to believe my own experiences over some numbers in a credit report. How do we know we can even trust the credit report?<br /><br />So, a person without any history will have a hard time getting a loan. That makes sense to me. What if emule came here asking for a loan? What if he had a perfect credit record? See, it matters more how a person has behaved in the past. The person matters most of all, the paperworks are just papers.<br /><br />As a person gets a history, people will see what type of person they are, how they interact with others and usually some sense of their skill level. As long as a person is not asking for a loan amount that is far in excess of their history/skill level, then they should get the loan.<br /><br />How will we know what amount is right? There is no formula, all needs to be done on a case by case basis. We need to make this process personal. The current real world banking process is the least personal of all the service businesses. It is only about what is in the computer, regardless of, well regardless of anything else. You get more personalized service at a McDonalds than the bank where your entire life situation might depend on<br /><br />Will some people take advantage of NXTbank, most likely. It is sad, but some people just dont have any honor. However, I dont think it will be so high a rate. <br /><br />Anyway, just wanted to drop in and say I like the asset sellback idea. It basically uses the small business asset as collateral. Very direct. very effective.<br /><br />James

Or something else?<br /><br />I'm trying to imagine the final product from end user perspective.<br /><br />Do you have some ROI estimation for InstantDEX?<br />Launch date?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You will have to ask wesley about the magic he will do, I am not GUI guy<br /><br />Still too many pieces that need to be pulled together for anything as specific as a launch date. We need to have crypto assets in AE first, so MGW is prerequisite. After that I will need a few weeks to finalize the low level code while wesley does the GUI. Then it will depend on testing.<br /><br />You can see the peer to peer UDP via the NXYsync encrypted chat. InstantDEX builds on NXTsync for the orderbook propagation. There is also the NXTsubatomic and NXTatomic, which are not exactly realtime, but since they are crypto trading oriented I put them into InstantDEX asset. Hopefully it wont be too confusing and be a nice bonus for InstantDEX holders.<br /><br />So I cant give a firm timeframe, but hopefully you can see the various pieces of InstantDEX as they finalize and integrate together<br /><br />James

Momentum plays, fundamental or only technical approach?<br />Thanks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>For our crypto investments we will usually only invest in ones that we feel are viable long term to hedge against short term price action that goes against us. So one type of investment would be the DRK/NXT trade based on the ratio. We will setup and track the few viable long term cryptos and trade when we feel the ratios are at short term extremes. <br /><br />We will also make opportunistic investments that have a short term positive ROI expectation, eg. NXTventure groundfloor or even earlier rounds.<br /><br />I will also be using the SVM tech that will go into SVMcoin to create high accuracy predictors for 2 hour time frame trades. This is still in development but I hope to get it perfected this year<br /><br />So, I cannot give any strict formulas but with the vast majority of my personal NXT in sharkfund, you will be piggybacking on my trades. I do not like to rely on strictly one type of trading method, eg, momentum only is not good if it has bad technicals and fundamentals. Certainly two of the three should be favorable and preferably all three.<br /><br />Now the SVM's will utilize millions of input features that account for momentum and technical factors but also a lot of other factors that simply have no name. It is hard to encode fundamental factors so that is done by only trading things that you dont mind getting stuck in for a while. Of course, if it is simply collapsing, stop losses will kick in to liquidate out of the position.<br /><br />With the capital base around 1000 BTC, we dont expect that any single trade will be a very large percentage of the overall portfolio.<br /><br />I intend to keep doing what has gotten me here so far.<br /><br />James

I am just afraid you didn't account for transparency issues and risk profiles of investors.&nbsp; As the different assets represents the risk profiles of different investor.<br /><br />Second question: what is the difference between nxtventure, j777 hodl, sharkfund0 and nxtshark?&nbsp; seems like all are profit oriented... <br /><br />As I understand, NxtVenture is where you integrate services into Nxt but apparently you also take risk in investing other assets like the Nxtshark (which invest in crypto and not Nxt services). j777hodl supposed to have all the issues you will be doing (but isn't this also what NxtVenture is).&nbsp; Sharkfund0 and Nxtshark is the same?&nbsp; I think a clear mission statement should be done for each asset.&nbsp; What will it invest in.&nbsp; A magna carta for each asset will be good.&nbsp; Because I invested in NxtVenture and was surprised that you used NxtVenture to invest in NxtShark.&nbsp; <br /><br />Investors are also getting worried and losing confidence on the amount of assets that you are issuing and handling.&nbsp; There are just too much assets that you are issuing.&nbsp; This can be seen on the price drop of the assets that you issued.&nbsp; I would suggest to slow down your pace because it is not good for the asset prices.<br /><br />Thanks for listening.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First off, thank you for the feedback. I am well aware of the issue of being overextended. That is why TEAM now has over a dozen people. Its not just me anymore. <br />I have been very careful to keep the value within each asset consistent with market value, for example all of the funds spent to purchase sharkfund0 is in the purchasing acct. I think the fact that NXT AE is not displaying the value of the sharkfund0 is what is causing concern. Dont forget to multiply each sharkfund0 by 10000 NXT to get a cash value.<br /><br />I do understand the concern about so many assets, and the TEAM finance group is in the process of creating materials to more clearly explain how everything is put together. Also, regular financials will be forthcoming, but you will need to pester voldemort for the details on the timing. I personally would request much more frequent reports than quarterly, would be nice to get realtime financial reports, but now that voldemort fell out of his chair, we probably need to wait a bit longer between reports<br /><br />In the meantime, you can just look at each account and see what it has. I have been very careful to make sure any exchanges were balanced with market value exchanges.<br /><br />If sharkfund goes bankrupt, that would mean that I personally would have lost millions of NXT as I have put the vast percentage of my personal NXT into sharkfund. I understand if you are not comfortable with the level of risk I take, but rest assured that capital preservation will be the primary concern with sharkfund. Owning portions of sharkfund allows the operating companies a place to park their funds and get more than forging revenues.<br /><br />One point that I should make. None of the current operating companies have large ongoing costs. The people who are working for them are not pulling down giant salaries, in fact the total salary cost right now for all of TEAM is less than $1000 per month. TEAM has no office buildings, or even office space. There are some servers, so the total overhead cost for TEAM is also less than $1000 per month. What this means is that with current cash reserves TEAM can operate for quite a long time. The usual economics of real world companies do not apply.<br /><br />As an InstantDEX asset holder, I do apologize that you will have to spend a bit of time making sure sharkfund is doing fine. As long as sharkfund capital base is secure, then InstantDEX ownership of sharkfund is not at risk.<br /><br />sharkfund0 is similar to an open ended fund. It represents investment capital. Investors who purchase sharkfund are piggy backing on my personal investment decisions and I now have voldemort to bounce ideas off of and we use a buddy system to make sure each investment has the proper risk/reward. Once the sharkfund begins active trading, we will have a mechanism for withdrawals. It is this mechanism that will allow InstantDEX to pull out its funds if things ever look too risky from its point of view.<br /><br />NXTshark is an asset that represents the trading of sharkfund. It is a private asset now and encapsulates the profits from trading sharkfund. The investors in sharkfund get 75% of profits and NXTsharks gets 25%. It is that 25% that is assetized. We do not expect there will be assets put on the market until July, but timing is hard to predict and will depend on market factors.<br /><br />NXTventure is the asset that represents the typical VC/investment bank cycle. It identifies (or creates) operations with promising tech and personnel and makes an investment that it assesses will be able to be sold to the market in the short term. Its investment timeframe is short term and so it will not take long to see if an investment has positive ROI. This is one of the reasons why I felt comfortable in parking InstantDEX funds in sharkfund. Since TEAM is many people and a lot of different tech and services represented by different assets, it was fragmenting the available capital. I intend to isolate the risk profile of each asset, otherwise there might as well be just one asset. There will be enough transparency to make sure that TEAM is living up to this.<br /><br />Also, NXTventure will be dividending out each month what is left from the new issues. NXTventure has not invested in sharkfund, it will be the other way around. sharkfund will invest in NXTventure if it senses a positive ROI opportunity. This arrangement quadrupled NXTventures available capital. For an investment company that is a very positive thing.<br /><br />For now the shark is sleeping. It just has a lot of NXT sitting in its account. When it sees an opportunity to make a positive ROI investment, it will. That is its charter. If NXTventure provides that opportunity, it makes sense for the shark to be able to have that opportunity.<br /><br />jl777hodl is not an active operating company, it simply has ~10% slices of the equity investments I have personally made. As I get new issues, I will keep adding to jl777hodl, so not only does it represent the current issues but all the future issues. I even put all of the external investments I have made there, bithaus, sianote even the 10% of MIC. jl77hodl will not be making investments, nor will it actively be trading things. I do have a proviso that occasionally it might rebalance the portfolio, but that is more for dealing with the external assets. This is the long term buy and hold fund that provides a single investment to get a slice of all my assets. As such I believe it provides the lowest risk profile.<br /><br />sharkfund0 is an opportunistic fund that will make short term investments it feels will have a positive ROI in the crypto space. So if there is an arbitrage it will do it. If there is a chance to put funds in at the groundfloor in a NXTventure offering, it will do it. sharkfund0 is a pooling of funds and all purchasers of sharkfund get the same return. From the smallest investor that puts in 1 NXT to the big whales who put in millions of NXT. I believe it is unique in the financial world to offer this.<br /><br />NXTventure is an operating company under which new issues of TEAM will be issued. I estimate approx a new internal issue per month, plus it also offers asset issuance service to other companies for a small fee. <br /><br />I hope that clarifies things. I realize there have been a lot of developments very quickly, but rest assured that this flurry of activity was because a week ago there was no structure at all. Now there are assets for operating companies, and options for the type of investment funds to choose from. Most importantly there is a structure moving forward that investors can count on for new issues via NXTventure<br /><br />NXTventure is for people that want to get a dividend of the form of the monthly new issues. <br /><br />sharkfund is for people that want to get the same investment performance as I personally get with my short term ROI objective.<br />NXTsharks is currently private, it gets a piece of sharkfund profits<br /><br />jl777hodl is for people that want a set it and forget it way to invest in the issues I am involved with. This is a long term investment.<br /><br />The rest are operating companies in their own space.<br /><br />James

					TEAM is building a global conglomerate of NXT based tech and financial services operations. There are assets that correspond to the results of a specific operation and there are assets that represent a horizontal slice across all operations. This allows investors with different risk profiles to pick and choose and create a blended portfolio that suits their preference. <br /><br />Those who want to go for maximum possible ROI without regard to risk would put all their funds into a single operating company. This is not recommended as it most likely exceeds the sleep test. Basically, if you are having trouble sleeping because you are worried about every price change, then you have invested too much. You need to diversify or simply reduce your exposure. If you dont get enough sleep and are in an emotional state, it will be hard to make good decisions.<br /><br />For those that dont want to or cant spend the time to analyze all the various operating companies to decide how best to allocate capital, there is the purely horizontal jl777hodl that acts like a mutual fund. It does have the added bonus that it will automatically get additional holdings as TEAM expands.<br /><br />Now let us discuss the sharkfund. I am very encouraged and happy to see so much invested in sharkfund. Thank you everyone for the trust and confidence! It does however create an operational issue. sharkfund being over 700 BTC on deposit makes it the #50 on coinmarketcap. This is more than the daily trading volume of all but a few cryptos. With my NXTsharks hat on, my job is to generate as much profits as I can for sharkfund investors. So, I negotiated a deal with the guys who are running NXTventure, NXTcoinsco and InstantDEX as they are sitting on a pile of NXT that they dont really need right at this moment.<br /><br />Their concern is that if they needed NXT for operations that they be able to do that and I assured them that it would be arranged. So most of the NXT in the various assets will be consolidated into sharkfund which will earn much more than forging if things go as planned. This helps the various operating assets. It also allows NXTventure to have access to a much larger fund.<br /><br />If anybody has questions please ask, I know it can be confusing. One way to think about it is that most of the NXT within TEAM will be put into sharkfund and that sharkfund will be able to participate in the funding round of NXTventure.<br /><br />Fundamentally nothing has really changed, it just increases the size of the account that NXTsharks manages and NXTventure gets access to the extra funds. This seems like a nice optimization over having idle NXT in various accounts just sitting there.<br /><br />James

I mean who can deny that a large corporation shouldnt be able to prevent their competitors from snooping. There must even be laws in usa that make it illegal for one corporation to spy on another, isnt there? Industrial espionage, I think is the term</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The difference is just marketing. It's not going to fool any government.<br /><br />And I think people care about their privacy as much, if not more than, businesses. One issue here is that they don't realise how lacking in privacy crypto-currencies potentially are. They are used to their credit card company knowing what they buy with their credit card, but not to everyone knowing. So you are trying to sell a solution to a problem they don't yet know exists.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Now, Industrial espionage operates at one level, actual espionage at a totally different level. The govt agencies wont have much problem cracking business strength protection, so they wont care.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So, we're talking privacy that is weakened some how so it can be broken by governments, but not by corporations? That's strikes me as a difficult balance to arrange. Some corporations are richer than some governments. Especially consider a computer company like IBM or Google. Google owns massive server farms. If they wanted to know, for example, the patent fees being paid by Android phone makers to Microsoft, they could bring enormous resources to bear.<br /><br />Maybe I'm not understanding what it is you have in mind here. Are you talking about unbreakable crypto, but with a secret backdoor for which only governments have the keys? Or what? This part of the proposal seems vague and under-examined.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/(poll-by-post)-does-nxt-need-anonymity/msg23767/#msg23767">Quote from: jl777 on May 18, 2014, 11:27:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">NXT provides different levels of privacy,however there would be some &quot;cost&quot; for the higher levels of privacy so I dont think everybody would go to Total Privacy</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This sounds like privacy will become stigmatised. Requesting increased privacy will cause eyebrows to be raised. What are you doing that suddenly needs to be done in secret?<br /><br />To be effective, privacy needs to be nearly ubiquitous and default-on. Like how the web has largely switched from HTTP to HTTPS. Or as a counter-example, like how now the emails are by default not encrypted, use of encrypted email is deemed suspicious.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">After all is the govt going to attack NXT for letting people select the amount of privacy they want?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>They can make it illegal to use privacy they can't circumvent. They can make it illegal for nodes to process private transactions.<br /><br />I'm not sure what technology you have in mind. Presumably it is initiated with a transaction. So governments can identity which accounts are issuing privacy transactions. They can identity which other accounts send to them. <br /><br /><br />I dunno, maybe &quot;optional&quot; is the wrong approach. As an alternative, perhaps all transactions above a certain value should be public, and only small-value ones should be private. The analogy here is with money laundering. Governments are only interest in people laundering large amounts of money. &quot;Know your customer&quot; laws don't kick in for small transactions, until their total volume becomes large.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>When did I say the goal was to fool anybody?<br />I just wanted to find a way to position this tech in a way that is non-controversial.<br />however you feel about this issue, I doubt you will have a credible argument against using a superior market positioning

There is no reason to do this.<br />NXT provides different levels of privacy,however there would be some &quot;cost&quot; for the higher levels of privacy so I dont think everybody would go to Total Privacy<br /><br />There will be performance loss, meaning it will be slower<br />At higher levels it would cost more, especially business level and Total Privacy<br /><br />I am talking about how to position this tech. If NXT establishes itself as the crypto that provides privacy, that will be good and noncontroversial. After all is the govt going to attack NXT for letting people select the amount of privacy they want? Using that logic, the govt should make all public toilet stalls totally transparent, after all if they cant see what you are doing then you might be doing something illegal.<br /><br />Do you think any govt could pass laws to make non-transparent toilet stalls illegal?<br />Even usa wouldnt be able to do that!<br /><br />The govt takes the position that everything we do has to be transparent.<br />I take the position that there are some things I would like to increase the privacy level on, dont you?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1. Privacy instead of anonymity - Yes<br />2. Options to toggle between them - Yes<br /><br /><strong>Question (if this was answered before, I apologize)</strong><br /><br />Let's say I'm a heavy regulated industry and don't want any of the upper levels of privacy transactions. Would I be able to toggle an option to deny receiving a transaction with a privacy setting above X?<br /><br />That might sound a bit anal... but for businesses, it allows them to comply with whatever level of privacy they are comfortable with without the burden being on NXT.&nbsp; <strong>I have a personal conviction toward complete anonymous transactions, however, I won't let me personal beliefs get in the way of what I feel is best for the ecosystem.</strong> Let consumers and businesses make the choice, we shouldn't push our personal beliefs on either. Let the market make the decisions that best suits their needs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Now that we have the Privacy Level framework, I think the proper options, defaults, etc will just be a matter of thinking through the various use cases and making sure there is a solution for all the required cases<br /><br />The key breakthrough was discovering the right framework to market the always controversial tech.<br />This is actually quite a breakthrough<br />For example, if we simply matched Darkcoin's level of tech, NXT wins due to the superior positioning<br />When we exceed Darkcoin's tech, then it is no contest
