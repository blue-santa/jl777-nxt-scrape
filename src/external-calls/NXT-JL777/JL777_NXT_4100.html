Then when you called all of NXT criminals, I took that as a resignation as does any reasonable person.<br /><br />In your world, maybe quitting when people are counting on you is normal, but around here people take their commitments seriously. THAT is what turned people against you.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I am too busy to engage this nonsense, so my not responding to your posts will only indicate that I feel it is even more nonsense and not tacit approval.

It seems clearer and clearer that you never intended to get anything done.<br /><br />I will state officially that you dont directly owe jl777 (James) anything, but you do owe 1 million NXT to NXTventure and indirectly all NXTventure asset holders.<br /><br />I will also state unofficially that your future in NXT and most likely all crypto is over. However I bet you can convince johnson to help with your new projects. He seems to think its just fine to keep the 1 million NXT without delivering anything.<br /><br />James

					Did anybody have any problems with MGW prior to oldnbold's &quot;mistake&quot; of withdrawing too much? <br />I think the bug is if the account balance goes negative the same block as there is a valid withdraw, so this might only be possible when we are stress testing. More info as I uncover the bug<br /><br />I think I will have fixed version out tonight, so another mass test tomorrow? Once it survives the mass withdraw test, then the only thing left would be the long term stability, which can only be verified by having it run long term as we continue to stress test it.<br /><br />@vanbreuk, please send enough NXT to all testers to pay for their tx costs and oldnbold deserves 250 NXT for this bug. I guess valarmg also should get 100NXT, but since I couldnt tell when and what tx killed it, it is not worth as much bounty

( crypto magic later )<br />If a lot of people send anon-transactions they all send their coins to 1984, so we are mixing them in this account.<br /><br />to proof to bob that alice actually send this coins to him, alice groups her coins in blocks of 50 coins, we will call this ShadowBlocks ( amount may vary, but amount values are predefiened, e.g. 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 ... )<br />for every ShadowBlock alice creates a special publickey that only bob has the corresponding private key.<br />for that alice creates an own keypair, adds the public key to bobs public key, and the resulting key is also a public key that bob can create the privatekey if he adds the private key of that block to his own privatekey.<br /><br />similar to this: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=84569.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=84569.0</a><br /><br />alice puts the transaction ID of her transaction to 1984, along with every block ( blockamount, publickey, special public key ) in a message and sends this data to account 1984.<br /><br />bobs sees the meassage on the blockchain and checks if he can create a privatekey that correesponds to the special public key, if he is successful, he can claim the coins when he wants to.<br />It is in bobs interrest to let those coins sit in the 1984 account until he needs to, so that his coins mix up with all the other transactions.<br /><br />If bob can proof that he knows the privatekey to one of the blocks that were sent to 1984, he can claim those coins and request to credit them to another account.<br />So bob wants to claim one of the 50 NXT Blocks:<br />To not reveal which block he owns, he requests the forger to encrypt a very large number with block pubkeys that he provides ( choosing many different blocks the he dosnt know the answer to, and only one block that he knows, all blocks must be of the same amount - 50 NXT) the forger then publishes the sha256 hash of his number, and the many encrypted versions of his number, bob now can get this number by encrypting &quot;his&quot; block, and tell the forger his secret number, along with the sha256 of that number which is already broadcasted this is public prove the he owns one of the blocks with a specific amount, without reveling which block he owns. bobs then gets that amount of nxt sent to an id he provides, from the 1984 account.<br />To avoid doublespend bob is not allowed to ever use one of the blocks he used in this transaction.<br /><br />Bob does this three times, cleverly mixing his blocks, and he got his 150 NXT, no one can tell who sent him this coins, or if it was one person, or two or three different persons who sent him NXT.<br /><br />It is in bobs interrest to choose blocks in a way that will not reveal where he got those coins from, for further payouts he should use blocks that came from the same transactions as the ones he previously used, basically bob is responsible for his own coin-mixing.<br /><br />Bob cam claim his coins at any time, the longer he lets them sit in the 1984 account, the &quot;more anonymized&quot; his transactions will be.<br /><br />if alice wantet to send 150 NXt to bob, and 320 NXT to vitctor, she could do this too, sending 470 NXT to 1984, split them up in blocks, and choose the special pubkey so that every reciever could only use his NXT, and put all those blocks for both recipients into one message.<br /><br /><br />I hope this is understandable, my english is not perfect <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Clever, but it doesn't seem too user friendly. There is no simple way to know how much next you have in the 1984 account. You would basically have to write down every transaction on pen and paper. Your idea of per-defined amounts would be very useful though.<br /><br />What if Alice sends a transaction of one of those predefined amounts to the 1984 account. The 1984 account creates a random password and associates its hash it with that amount on a single block side chain, I will call it a shadow chain. It sends the password back to Alice on a single block side-chain for her to copy and paste (or write down) somewhere safe. She then clicks ok when she is finished and her side-chain is deleted and written over by the next side chain somebody else uses (that way it is completely gone forever). Alice (or one of her friends) then sends a message with that password and Bob's NXT address on another one block side-chain. The 1984 account checks the password's hash against the hashes in it's database and deletes the side chain for it to be written over again. It then sends that amount of NXT to Bob and deletes the shadow chain and writes over it with another shadow chain for somebody else.<br /><br /><br />Advantages of this approach:<br /><br />All side chains are written over by the end so there is no data left to prove who sent who what amount<br />Bob can receive his NXT in only a few blocks.<br />Only the amount owed is stored (not the exact coins) so Bob receives whatever NXT 1984 spits out rather than the NXT that Alice sent to the 1984 account.<br />Because the data is stored on chains that are written over, it does not bloat the blockchain too much.<br /><br />Disadvantages of this approach:<br /><br />A bug on Alice's computer could trace the person she sent it to, leaving both parties exposed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>once there is any way to do this, it can all be automated.<br />I think it is better to split this into two halfs. One half is the implementation of a &quot;pay to secret&quot; or &quot;pay to xxx&quot; half where it binds the NXT in the &quot;1984&quot; acct. There can be no info sent back to the one that binds it as that would negate all privacy, so clearly Alice needs to send hash(X) or some secret that only she knows how to generate along with NXT<br /><br />So now NXT is in the &quot;1984&quot; acct. Alice has the secret that unlocks this, also others know that Alice has done this. So we also need many other people who do this for this to provide privacy. Assuming this, now to spend it, Alice needs a secure and nontraceable way to send the secret to Bob. How about NXTsync encrypted chat? no trace on blockchain and Bob can cash it in and nobody will know for sure it was from Alice or anybody else that bound the NXT in the past.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />IDK anything about NXT sync so I guess I am out of the loop. But that does sound like it would work. Only thing is that an encryption can be broken. Does the chat delete and write over the data? If not, with enough time, somebody could find out who Alice sent the password to and then privacy would be broken.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>unless agency is keeping a log of every UDP packet sent on the internet, then there is no place to get the data. chat simply gets the input line, encrypts it and sends it. Also, I dont use the NXT acct key, I autogenerate a new keypair each time NXTservices is started. This isolates the keys from anything that is permanently in the blockchain.<br /><br />so with the log of all UDP, a mapping of IP to NXT address for this log and breaking a per session keypair (using Bernsteins nacl library), then yes Alice would be vulnerable. Now if that level of attack on privacy is being made, I would think private surveillance would need to be accounted for. What if they are pointing lasers at her windows to hear everything she is saying and recording everything visible and planted transmitters in her computer.<br /><br />There is no 100% privacy, short of being inside the deep undergound faraday shielded bunkers of these agencies themselves.<br />

I wont put any value to having a real world identity. After reflecting on what happened, I have realized that is what caused my mistake. I substituted having real world identity for forum track record, especially since he was actively engaging bitcoin core developers in meaningful debates. Unfortunately I did not see the Open Transactions thread until just recently.<br /><br />In anycase NXTautoDAC completed the NXTventure cycle, so moving forward it will be new assets to put into the pipeline. voldemort is still locked up with real world stuff, so the June offering will probably be delayed. Now I am working on several unpublished assets and recent events will not change my long term efforts at all, maybe I will not be seeking external coders, so a possible delay in the release cycles, but at least no chance of another incident like this!<br /><br />People kept saying I am doing too many coding projects myself. So I actively sought out other coders to lessen my workload. maybe I should just do all the coding myself? just dont complain that I am doing too many coding projects!<br /><br />cointropolis was very busy with payexpo and prior to that we had one possible deal, but have not heard anything else from him. I have no idea what his plans are at this point.<br />
