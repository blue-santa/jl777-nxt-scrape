Imagine AE where you can trade any asset directly against any asset. Imagine AE where you can ... (gotta keep some stuff secret for now)<br /><br />All of this built on a hub and spoke topology that is the exact match for what TF needs and a plan to allow people who host pNXTd servers to monetize, hopefully enough to pay for the cost of hosting maybe even a small profit.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. For those that are wondering, yes, Privatebet, NXTsync and NXTcoinsco will all probably use pNXTd

That is 47.7x the total supply of bitcoins:<br /><br />1,000,000,000 / 21,000,000 = 47.7<br /><br />Now since the price is $600 a BTC, that means NXT value should be 47x less of the value of what that is: $12 per nxt which is the potential.<br /><br />But as of today. there is only 13 million BTC. so we'll have to adjust those numbers again:<br /><br />1,000,000,000 / 13,000,000 = 77<br /><br />Now at $600 btc price we divide by 77 = $7.7 per NXT<br /><br />Is this correct? And the potential of this just from the price alone?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What you are describing is marketcap parity. Basically at the price of $7.7 NXT marketcap matches BTC marketcap.<br />Ignoring the network effect, marketcap parity should be the FLOOR price for NXT. After all NXT is a total superset of bitcoin. However, we cant ignore the network effect. As soon as NXT has as many users as bitcoin, then we can expect this sort of calculation to be meaninful<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S.

					<a href="http://209.126.70.170/pNXTd" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.70.170/pNXTd</a> Ubuntu pNXTd privacyServer<br /><a href="http://209.126.70.170/pNXTlite.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.70.170/pNXTlite.zip</a> includes both Mac and win32 pNXTlite client<br /><br />You can use 209.126.70.159 as a privacyServer for the pNXTlite clients, the 170 server is apt to have the current experimental version and also much less likely to be available. I will try to keep 159 running a relatively stable version<br /><br />James<br /><br /><br /><br />The location has changed by a little bit:<br /><br /><a href="http://209.126.71.170/InstantDEX_t00" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.71.170/InstantDEX_t00</a> this is for Mac only and it is a thin client, you can test the API locally so still quite useful without any server<br /><br /><a href="http://209.126.71.170/pNXTd" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.71.170/pNXTd</a> is a prebuilt ubuntu privacyServer daemon. I have a couple instances running, but this is a decentralized system so the more the merrier and at some point it will be nice to have quite a few live to measure propagation times.<br /><br />The source for pNXTd is at <a href="https://github.com/jl777/pNXT" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://github.com/jl777/pNXT</a> and you can build it on Mac or Ubuntu. If you have pNXTd running, then you dont need the thin client. This means the API is fully functional on Ubuntu. Of course, what is supposed to be and what is are two different things. Much chance for bugs.<br /><br />So what is this InstantDEX release? Why is it pNXT, wasnt that a privacy thing?<br />Well, yes, but I said I was interested in the cryptonote tech for more than just the privacy. Now the cat is out of basket. I am using the peer to peer network for InstantDEX. I figure why reimplement a nice field tested peer to peer system when I can just tweak it for my purpose <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />So, the InstantDEX network will be riding on the pNXT nodes quite directly. However, considering the size of the download and the difficulty in building and the lack of 32 bit windows support, I realized a client/server approach was needed and that fits right into the privacyServer network I envisioned. Before you say aha! client/server, its centralized. I say, not exactly. Anybody an setup a privacyServer and it will be a bunch of servers each with 1 to N clients. Think decentralized hubs and some centralization around each hub. Basically the exact infrastructure we need for TF.<br /><br />So, when you run the InstantDEX_t00 (testnet for Mac) it will initialize in less than a minute and start in local mode as far as InstantDEX goes. You can do all the orderbook commands but it wont go to the network, think &quot;broadcast=false&quot;.<br /><br />I have implemented a universal orderbook system that automatically creates new orderbooks on demand. Each orderbook is between two assets, assetA and assetB. Pure NXT will be considered asset #5527630, kudos if you can figure out why I chose that as the asset number for NXT. A little puzzle fun <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />So, the first step is to create an orderbook. You will notice on the API page there is place ask and place bid and they both have assetA and assetB fields. Most all the time you will just put in the orderbook id so the asset fields will be blank, but at first when there are no orderbooks we have to jumpstart it. I dont enforce the error checking but assetA &lt; assetB is how it will end up, so if you put in backwards it will flip it on you so dont complain if things are backwards from what you wanted.<br /><br />After you submit the place bid/ask, you should get back a JSON with the orderbook id. If you forget, you can just use the get all orderbooks API to get a list of all the orderbooks. When creating an orderbook, the actual order values are ignored so there wont be any active orders. You can verify this with get orderbook API. Notice there is a polarity field, -1 will flip things around, so the orderbook that you get will be reversed, eg. NXT/BTC or BTC/NXT depending on polarity<br /><br />Now the fun begins. You can put in bids or asks in either positive or negative polarity. A bit complicated, but I think I got it all right, please verify as it is very easy to make mistake with this sort of thing. Everything is just numbers that all look not so crazy.<br /><br />Once you start getting bids and asks, the get orderbook API is returning much more interesting things. If you set &quot;allfields&quot; to 1, it will display more info on each order, for now just the NXT address of the one who made the bid/ask. The orderbook JSON should be sorted in the right way, eg. decreasing for bids and increasing for asks.<br /><br />Finally, I explains the specifics on how to put in a bid or ask. You need to orient yourself as to the polarity of the orderbook, its the difference between 12000 and .00008333. I decided to use floating point for inputing the price and volume. The display resolution goes to millisatoshis, eg. 11 digits, but internally it is good for a few more so I dont expect there to be much millisatoshi gremlins, though on windows machines anything is possible. So you can put in bids in prices at millisatoshi resolution and the volume has satoshi resolution. I think this is a pretty good range for trading. Now do not worry, the actual order gets converted from this price + volume format to unsigned 64 bits of satoshi precision for each asset. This is unlike how NXT does it where you are limited in digits for either the volume or price. With InstantDEX you dont have to worry about the decimal places an asset has. Just put in the exact amount you want with a millisatoshi price. I have not decided how to deal with rounding issues of assets without enough decimals. Maybe I will keep an internal tracking or maybe not. For now, I ignore this, so while it is true that the orderbook could display prices that are a bit different than what you put in due to (price + volume) -&gt; (amountA + amountB) -&gt; (price + volume), it will be interesting to see just how big this &quot;problem&quot; is.<br /><br />Once you are comfortable with the API functioning, then you can select a privacyServer. For now use 209.126.70.159 unless you got one of your own running, then just put the IP address of your server in the &quot;select my privacyServer&quot; form on the :7777 page. this is the true test of decentralization, to see if the orderbooks synchronize with multiple servers. Once you are connected to a privacyServer, your API requests are routed to the privacyServer and broacast to the network. The responses you will get back should be quite similar to local mode, though the txid&#039;s will be quite different. Also, you might not need to create orderbooks, but for now I am not even verifying the asset ids are valid, it is all just input testing.<br /><br />I dont have the ordermatching done yet, but just getting the orderbooks synchronized in less than 5 seconds (I hope) is a key achievement, especially with a decentralized topology. For now, please be nice to API, not much error handling so if you do bad things, maybe even crash, not sure. All bugs are important though.<br /><br />I will try to get a windows version of InstantDEX_t00 out tomorrow, but I really dont like doing windows stuff, maybe I go to dentist instead.<br /><br />I still need to deal with the rounding of assets without enough decimals, verifying assets exist and of course the actual trade matching. There is quite a lot of new stuff here, so please test thoroughly.<br /><br />James<br />

After that it shouldnt be necessary to update the blockchain. Of course, you might end up making raw transaction bytes that get rejected if you exceed the funds you have, but as long as you generate offline tx that would succeed the procedure is:<br /><br />*****<br />One time initialization of blockchain to the point where your account is seen. After this the computer can be permanently disconnected from Internet and any LAN. If you are really paranoid, then generate the blockchain on a different computer and copy the nxt folder ONCE. After this the offline computer only generates files on USB (or even floppies if you still have those!)<br /><br />The key to making this end user possible is for the GUI to have a checkbox for offline mode where it simply displays the transaction bytes or even better to offer to save to file. Then in online mode having a way to load the file that was created offline.<br />******<br /><br />@wesleyh PLEASE implement this!!<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Blockchain is irrelevant.

No blockchain needed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes! you are clever guy, strange sense of humor, but clever!<br />publicKey:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field in sendMoney. I always wondered why we needed that. So, you just put the dest acct's public key in the API call and then no blockchain needed at all. <br /><br />

That way at least if the black helicopters get me, my work wont be lost. I have taken extra precautions and I have no permanent physical location so I am less vulnerable than someone whose permanent address is known. <br /><br />Progress is our best weapon. continue with the disruptive tech until there is no point for the enemy to continue their campaign against us.

I am simply stating that there may be lurkers waiting to see how they can get involved, this might be the final push/ incentive to get them involved while the community and klee reap the benefits killing two birds with one stone...you strike me as&nbsp; avery reasonable person from your history...but I can&#039;t understand why this is unreasonable to you...I think the people who are up for this should make there voices known to see even if there is any weight to it all all.<br /><br />ps&nbsp; it doesn&#039;t even have to be nxt specific...it could be a crypto-wide community thing...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am not hearing these new voices, but if there are such people, then of course I would not be against it.<br />In my experience any significant effort like this invariably involves the key people and it will be hard to insulate them from getting involved.

In my case, I took these criticisms as a bit of incentive to show them totally wrong, but I have been in situation to do sales and there is no way I would have been able to do good sales work under constant negative commentaries and lack of community support.<br /><br />Since most people here are technical types maybe they dont understand psychology and motivation and how important that is for sales. If you cant do sales then please stop criticizing people that have actually done sales. Maybe you dont like their sales achievements, but who has achieved anymore? It is like people that dont know how to code telling me how horrible I am at coding. The best I can do is ignore it.<br /><br />James

Quite the contrary I made a post earlier today about NXT having to make something like Keepass be a built-in part of the client if we ever want mass adoption.

With klee's physical location known, no amount of online security would have helped as physical surveillance can capture passwords in any number of methods.<br /><br />I assess the odds of the half dozen+ recent attacks all being random hack events at less than 3%, meaning 97% chance of some external coordination that is orchestrating things. <br /><br />Due to this, I am changing to a totally open-source policy for all my work. That way at least if the black helicopters get me, my work wont be lost. I have taken extra precautions and I have no permanent physical location so I am less vulnerable than someone whose permanent address is known. <br /><br />Progress is our best weapon. continue with the disruptive tech until there is no point for the enemy to continue their campaign against us. Already the market caps created by NXT forks/clones is larger than the new BTC forks/clones, soon it will be unstoppable, lets just not slow down with wild goose chases. If there are any Chinese lawyers that can help with BTER funds recovery, then by all means do that, but what else is productive?<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. If anybody doubts the wisdom of BCNext's decision to stay anonymous, maybe now we can agree he is one smart guy!
