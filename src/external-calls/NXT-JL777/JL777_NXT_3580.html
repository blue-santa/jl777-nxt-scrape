					Heads up on BTCD on bittrex is still trading at around .00015<br /><br />I already got what I needed. There will only be ~1.6 million after PoW phase is over in two weeks. After that it is a slow 5% per year to 22 million coins, not sure how many years that will take. So this will be a relatively scarce coin in PoS mode in a couple weeks.<br /><br /><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=684090.msg7863290#msg7863290" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=684090.msg7863290#msg7863290</a><br /><br />BTCD was looking for someone in the community to add features to it and so that is what I will do <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Dont worry, this wont dilute my NXT efforts, in fact it nicely solves a problem of needing a free floating transport currency for pNXTd and the more pNXTd nodes, the better for NXT as each pNXTd node will require NXT. Also, this is good news for InstantDEX, Privatebet, etc. that will all be part of pNXTd as the more users, the better for trading and privacy<br /><br />James

Users can then choose between the centralized pNXT with zero fees or the fully decentralized BTCD with some market slippage and spread costs. <br /><br />Not sure of all the details yet, just got the idea of dual transport currencies. <br /><br />If this is acceptable, then the concept is to maximize the number of pNXTd nodes and the BTCD community has lots of hardware and the more users that are connected to the pNXTd network the better for InstantDEX, Privatebet, privacy in general, etc.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ah, I see, you'll have combined pNXT/BTCD/NXT nodes to maximize the amount of them. Nice!<br /><br />Dual transport currencies seem a great idea.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Who are you? What have you done with valarmg?<br />Are you the satoshi gremlins using brain control?<br /><br /><img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />When encountering a really difficult problem, find an easier one. Intuitively the forced dual pegging was cool, but not really possible to decentralize, could get close with some contortions, but all solved with a decentralized free floating currency. The BTCD community is welcoming this with big excitement and the coin's founder is fully supporting. I have found that the existing cryptonote coins are already set on their path and not really open to anything as radical as grafting on a realtime exchange, multigateways, sports betting, etc. into their coin.<br /><br />So now, intuitively it feels like a solvable problem, though still with challenges ahead. Thanks for the critical feedback, it really helped to make a better solution possible. I also think all the BTCD guys will be really happy, few of them understand just how important the free floating pNXTd currency will be.<br /><br />James

If dogecoin devs want support, they copy the litecoin file into github/doge_MGWsupport.c and build the MGW and get that working. You then review and include and if something goes wrong with doge, then the doge guys fix.<br /><br />But probably a bad idea, especially if RAM is the main problem.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Here is your plugin:<br /><br />#define DOGE_COINID 4<br />#define DOGE_CONF &quot;dogecoin&quot;<br />#define DOGE_TXFEE 1.0000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// don't forget to match txfee with coin<br />#define DOGE_NXTEQUIV 100<br />#define DOGE_MIN_CONFIRMS 3<br />#define DOGE_PORT &quot;127.0.0.1:22555&quot;<br />#define DOGE_FIRST_BLOCKHEIGHT 216981&nbsp; <br /><br />The above is really all that needs to be changed. I could even make it part of a JSON string passed in from commandline<br />The big problem is server RAM, not software support

With InstantDEX, Privatebet and others built into pNXTd, the larger the installed base the better. Same for privacy, the more people using it, the better. <br /><br />To this end, I will be adding pNXTd support into BTCD and am now one of the devs!<br /><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=684090.msg7863395#msg7863395" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=684090.msg7863395#msg7863395</a><br /><br />The concept of bidirectional gateways is the key to allow for quick integration. If this can be done at the source/linker level it is tightly bound, but it can also be done at the RPC level. I might be crazy, but I think we can have multiple native currencies all coming into and out of pNXT-land and all of them tied together via InstantDEX and NXT AE.<br /><br />I will avoid any economic theoretical discussions, there seems to be enough of that going around today.<br /><br />Anyway, with this approach, it could well be that we dont want any price pegging. We can use the ripple approach and let things free float. As long as the price stays the same during the privateSend, then it is all good. So, the initial funding can set the initial exchange rate, but rather than fixing it (which causes all sorts of issues), we let it float based on free market. As long as there are private enterprises who provide decent spreads and liquidity, then the privateSends remain efficient, though it would end up with some amount of fees. However, those fees can go to the pNXTd nodes, so that avoids needing subsidies.<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First some thoughts, I had based on your last post on this subject(and hadn't got around to typing up). You talked about not allowing anyone to store pNXT except for privacy servers. Which solves some problems. However, if you look at it from the Nxt blockchain point of view, all that is happening is that Nxt is being sent to a community pool of NXT and then NXT is being distributed to various addresses. In effect, it becomes a coin mixer and all the pNXT network is doing is passing on instructions of where to send the NXT, the full anonymity of the network isn't being used. Users need the ability to own and hold pNXT and transfer directly to and from their pNXT account to gain a decent amount of anonymity.<br /><br />Assuming holding pNXT is possible, I think it's a good idea to allow access of pNXT addresses from inside the Nxt client. So a lite pNXT wallet as part of NxtServices, so advanced users don't have to go back to NXT all the time for their privacy needs. People can use privacySend and get some coin mixing, or they can have a float of pNXT for sending and receiving money with a much greater level of anonymity.<br />&nbsp;<br />So, your new solution. I had been thinking about the option of letting the pNXT float, but as you said, there's the problem of spreads. However, it solves a great many other problems and does allow a decentralized solution.<br /><br />If you are going to let it float, I don't think there's any point in you buying it all. Maybe a good idea is that if you distribute it to everyone who runs a privacyServer (in batched amounts[or via something like nodecoin] to incentivize continued use for a certain length of time). As additional privacyServers come online, they get decreasing amounts until a large portion of the pNXT is distributed. (Hopefully, by then the fees will make continuing to run servers attractive. Also this method of distribution would have a small amount of pNXT out initially, then that would increase as the pNXT network increased in usage.) A smaller % of the pNXT can be held for development, possibly.<br /><br />Of course, with no pegging, and everything done via InstantDex, there is no real need for pNXT. Users could choose BoolBerry, or BTCD or another currency for their privateSend needs and they already have a userbase and an exchange rate. There are advantages to pNXT, but just thought I'd mention that idea.<br /><br />Ok, back to assuming pNXT. Ideally, we want a spread of zero on the exchange and just fees. Also, we'd probably like low volatility in the NXT/pNXT rate if people are going to hold pNXT. I'm not sure how the exchange rate would be set given the closed system. Maybe you can use competition between privacyServers (which also have a minimum fee). So a pNXT&lt;&gt;NXT conversion is offered to the network and the Servers offering the best rates do the conversion (can be split between several Servers). I guess if they are all running the same software that doesn't make sense, maybe some algorithm can decide rates.<br /><br />I don't understand what you are doing with BTCD--you are adding easy exchange ability between that and pNXT?<br /><br />And the bidirectional gateways allow for exchanging coins without going through the multigateway and AE?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I want to have cake and eat it too <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />What if pNXT is the pegged transport currency and BTCD is the floating transport currency? Users can then choose between the centralized pNXT with zero fees or the fully decentralized BTCD with some market slippage and spread costs. <br /><br />Not sure of all the details yet, just got the idea of dual transport currencies. <br /><br />If this is acceptable, then the concept is to maximize the number of pNXTd nodes and the BTCD community has lots of hardware and the more users that are connected to the pNXTd network the better for InstantDEX, Privatebet, privacy in general, etc.<br /><br />James<br />

It is partly my sense of elegance and economy, not to needlessly multiply entities. I'm not sure if I can explain this aesthetic to someone who doesn't already share it, though. This isn't to say multiple solutions are always wrong; rather that redundancy needs to be justified.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you like AT, then use AT.

Everyone who works on Nxt core has to support them all. Everyone who writes a tool that works with blocks; everyone who wants to read a transaction and know what it is doing. Once in, they must be part of the core forever (else historic block-chains can't be verified). I think it's great that Nxt can support multiple solutions, really I do, but I also fear an accumulation of crud and bloat.<br /><br />(PS I'm off to bed now. It's 11pm in the UK.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I have bad news for you if you dont like redundancy.<br />Blockchain is redundant<br /><br />Even I dont need to know about every API NXT has, and I think I am one of the more active users of NXT API. NXT is modular so as long as the modules are not depending on each other, then there is no need (though of course desirable) for core devs to know all the details about the other modules. That is why it is called modules, modular.<br /><br />Anyway, NXT is decentralized and nobody can stop anybody from developing additions. The way I understand it, a new tx-type gets its own handler and it lives in its own universe. Granted each tx will use a bit of CPU on all the nodes, but so far the CPU usage is minimal and moore's law should be able to keep the percentage used to the current type of level<br /><br />So dont worry that NXT will get too many languages

And then they can grow to (11 x 11) when that proves desirable, and to (12 x 12), all the way up to (1000 x 1000), at whatever rate we feel comfortable with. Where as switching from SC to AT involves a change of language.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">P.S. If we had pre-canned solutions to all useful things an AT can do, then it seems quite a good approach especially if it avoids the incalculable risks of allowing free running code.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Agreed. However, as I understand it, SC does not provide pre-canned solutions. It will be a language, albeit a simpler and less capable one. We will have to learn how to read and write smart contracts in this language. It won't - can't - be so simple as to eliminate bugs.<br /><br />Also, part of the argument in favour of AT is the claim that it can be done safely. It isn't &quot;free running code&quot;. It doesn't embed Java bytecodes into transactions, or anything uncontrolled like that.<br /><br />(Incidentally, I'm not opposed to functional languages. Or even to using one that is initially not Turing Complete, provided that TC-ness can be added later. I do think that Turing Completeness will be needed in the long run, and I think it would be shame to end up having to learn 4 languages to use Nxt: Java, <a href="https://nxtforum.org/automated-transactions/semi-automated-transactions/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Kushti's pattern-matching state machine</a>, Come-from-Beyond's SQL SELECT scheme mentioned here, and Automated Transaction opcodes when they eventually get done.)<br /><br />(I'm also not opposed to pre-canned solutions. Although implementing such is in some ways harder and slower; anything that goes into the core needs to be bug-free, and it needs to fill a lasting need. The core devs need to accept it, and all the nodes need to be upgraded for it. If we had AT, effective new features could be added with it quickly, safely, with only client changes. The best ones could be integrated more efficiently into the core later; foolish ones could be discarded.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What is wrong with multiple solutions?<br />I think that is the only issue here. If you like AT, then use AT. If somebody likes SQL based then they SQL. If someone want to do FSM, they do FSM.<br />Nobody said you had to do all of them. If one works that is good enough.<br /><br />NXT is going to be very big, limiting it to just one language is like saying all programs to run on Internet must be written in C. While I wouldnt mind that, I bet all the python guys would scream <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James

					@valarmg<br /><br />OK, I now make things a lot more interesting.<br /><br />I realized that the pNXTd can interface to pretty much anything it can interface to. With InstantDEX, Privatebet and others built into pNXTd, the larger the installed base the better. Same for privacy, the more people using it, the better. <br /><br />To this end, I will be adding pNXTd support into BTCD and am now one of the devs!<br /><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=684090.msg7863395#msg7863395" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=684090.msg7863395#msg7863395</a><br /><br />The concept of bidirectional gateways is the key to allow for quick integration. If this can be done at the source/linker level it is tightly bound, but it can also be done at the RPC level. I might be crazy, but I think we can have multiple native currencies all coming into and out of pNXT-land and all of them tied together via InstantDEX and NXT AE.<br /><br />I will avoid any economic theoretical discussions, there seems to be enough of that going around today.<br /><br />Anyway, with this approach, it could well be that we dont want any price pegging. We can use the ripple approach and let things free float. As long as the price stays the same during the privateSend, then it is all good. So, the initial funding can set the initial exchange rate, but rather than fixing it (which causes all sorts of issues), we let it float based on free market. As long as there are private enterprises who provide decent spreads and liquidity, then the privateSends remain efficient, though it would end up with some amount of fees. However, those fees can go to the pNXTd nodes, so that avoids needing subsidies.<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />James

MGW is open. Meaning anybody can do a realtime audit on all the account balances and compare against the outstanding assets. In fact, the MGW client does this when configured with bitcoin-qt.

This is something that you overlook and I think could be one of the most powerful MGW advantages. You dont have to trust the issuer to not do fractional reserve, it is all there on the blockchain and the MGW clients can monitor this block by block.

I could sure use an issuer for all the various altcoins for InstantDEX to trade. Just keep the fees low so there are no barriers to getting the deposits. I will be kicking back a percentage of the InstantDEX trade commissions to the MGW gateways and maybe I will do this for all assets that trade via InstantDEX.<br /><br />I was thinking of allowing adding support of a new coin via commandline JSON that sets the variables, but ran out of time.<br /><br />Adding a new coin is pretty fast, so that was the other reason I didnt bother.

You will probably also need to define your gateway's NXT acct # and the IP addresses for your severs, but I am pretty sure it is just a matter of changing the right variables to get setup.<br />
