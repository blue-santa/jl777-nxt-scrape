The Nxt Foundation, or some representative of Nxt that can enter business agreement signs a deal, which specifies restrictions on what features of Nxt that specific blockchain is not allowed to run. Being under MIT license, of course any company can decide not to enter such a deal and just clone the whole Nxt platform, but then they get no support from the Nxt developers or community, and no right to use the &quot;powered by Nxt&quot; branding. Most businesses like Jetcoin are likely to need only a small subset of all Nxt features - I guess balance leasing, aliases, DGS, MS (or at least some MS currency versions), coin shuffling (coming in 1.6), are not needed and not relevant for Jetcoin. Other businesses may want just the DGS, but not the AE or coin shuffling because of the legal liabilities associated with running those.<br /><br />This compromise ensures that the Nxt blockchain is always the real thing, with all advanced features, the developers provide paid support to such white label customers, and the Nxt stakeholders are more confident that Nxt value is not going to be diluted by multiple companies using the software on their own blockchains.<br /><br />Since all nodes in a blockchain need to accept the same transaction types, enforcing such restrictions is very simple, it is not like a company can run an &quot;unlicensed&quot; version only on a few machines. And if they at some point decide they need some more features enabled, the Nxt community votes whether to approve modifying the agreement.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Amazing idea, I approve of it!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes, this method solves all the issues. I like it a lot too<br /><br />James

So that spending one half reveals the secret that allows the other side to spend their half<br /><br />and yes, typically the secret will be some sort of hashed high entropy value, as long as it is 100 bytes -&gt; 800 bits of data, I think that is plenty

I have had funds of mine just arbitrarily confiscated by USSA and had a business deal destroyed. No warning, no due process, just funds taken away. Additionally this insane rule about having to have utility bills in your own name to be able to have bank accounts, the USSA is forcing all other countries to adopt this, as it is a proven fact that terrorists cant ever have utility bills in their own name. However, in many countries only the owner of a proper is able to get utility bills in their name, so this makes it impossible for renters to open bank accounts. Thank you very much for that USSA, now the children are safe.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I am not saying the govts of other countries are any better, in fact you are probably right that they are usually worse, the difference is most dont bother to pretend they are not corrupt and most are not imposing their laws onto other countries

We had a long discussion about ways this can be mitigated. Currently the direction is to rely on account control to prevent this. This means that this specific scenario won't be supported before 1.6. <br />In 1.5 you'll be able to approve multiple phased transactions with the same approval transaction but the last approver can front run its own approval transaction with a different approval.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />After some more brainstorming, I believe we have a working solution that I will implement for 1.5. It will be possible to use phasing to make two transactions of any type atomic (they are either both executed, or both not executed), as long as at least one of them is phasing safe (asset transfers and AE orders are safe). And the good news is that this will not require any additional transactions, just the two that need to be coupled.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>this is fantastic news!!

Though it sound impressive <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /><br />Is that feature added to the NXT coins, or is it a new core with new chain?<br />What is a use-case of this connection thing?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It's a modification of the NRS code base, where you can hook in &quot;listeners&quot; of events. And I agree with you, this is a techy thingie.<br /><br />For example, let's say you are the developer for an exchange that use NXT and you want to know when a new transaction comes in to show it to your customer on your site.<br />Today you'll have to poll the NRS client, asking it every 10-20 seconds with the &quot;getUnconfirmedTransactions&quot; api function, and filtering out transactions that you already know about.<br />With NXT PLUS you can subscribe to the &quot;addedUnconfirmedTransactions&quot; event and the NRS code will, in real time let your code know that a new unconfirmed transaction has arrived.<br /><br />There's lots of technical advantages with the second approach:<br />- You can show the transaction on your site in real time, instead of having to wait x seconds until your next poll.<br />- Not as complex code for you to write when you know that the transaction you recieve is indeed a new transaction and thus no special handling is required.<br /><br />The big benefit comes in when you need to handle blocks, forks, knowing what transactions that got included in the new chain, etc. Those technical advantages you got from using NXT PLUS is really helping you out then.<br /><br />PS. I have nothing to do with this project, I just found out about it yesterday, but these are the advantages I see.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>why polling at 20 seconds?<br />access to localhost is very fast, you can poll multiple times per second without any problems<br />still a push type of interface would have good use cases<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Constantly polling localhost multiple times per second sure leads to a hot CPU, but what API to use? You need unconfirmed txns, confiremed txns and then they are constantly switched about from confirmed to unconfiremed when your node is switching forks. So when polling you basically need to constantly poll txns, unconfirmed txns, and blocks, thats already 3 API calls.<br /><br />As NxtSwe says a push based arcitecture allows for much cleaner code, I was able to throw out roughly half the code of mofowallet simply by switching to an event based system. Plus it leads to the situation where each piece of data in mofowallet now is updated in realtime without the need to write any polling code.<br /><br />What is not in the docs is there are also peer events available. I&#039;ve copied the part from mofowallet that uses it for any one interested..<br /><br /><a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/10716694/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://paste.ubuntu.com/10716694/</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />If it is so awesome, why don't make this the standard approach in NRS?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>compatibility issues<br />websockets is browser version specific, at least that is what I understand
