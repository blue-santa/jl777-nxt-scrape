The hard part is speeding up the withdraw process 100 fold <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Assuming the gremlins are gone and that BTC syncs up, I will take the servers offline. Then I need to have peoples make a bunch of withdraws, nothing to major, but a couple dozen total.<br />Then I will be able to test batch withdraw logic and also network acceptance error checking<br /><br />At that point, the only thing left is dynamic minconfirms adjustment on the NXT network side, but that will require nodecoin to come to life, so it will take a few days more. So I will make a release before I start on that and just use a fixed minconfirm amount.<br /><br />My hope is to get withdraw throughput to be able to handle a nearly arbitrary amount of volumes.Not quite what the deposit side can handle, but pretty close, so there really wont be any weaknesses of MGW<br /><br />James

After this transaction is accepted in a block that you forged on your fork, restore your network connection.

					The automatic fork detect and exit function worked. What this means is that since MGW server being on a fork is bad and I dont properly handle it yet, I just exit. Then when it is restarted, it should be back on the main chain. I know not elegant, but&nbsp; this is just until I get it properly handled<br /><br />So, one of the three MGW servers went offline, it has restarted caught up and I see some tx going out. I also fixed sending of AM, there was a bug where each restart it sent out all the deposit address AM's again. Now this means it might have gone too far and not send an AM for a new deposit address<br /><br />LTC is all caught up, and in sync to the satoshi. BTC has several more withdraw's to handle, so within an hour I hope BTC will be all caught up and in sync.

Mentioned it long ago: Vericoin has some really smart ideas. Their forging algo based on game theory is IMO even copyworthy.<br /><br />As for anonymity in NXT: jl777 threw some ideas around. Basically it is planned to add some privacy options. But it seems very far into the future, as other features took center stage. jl777's upcoming privacy assets are for supporting a little bit of it when I got it right - basically coin mixing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>NXTprivacy will have a coin mixing as part of its privacy suite, but this is simply due to the fact that NXT does not have txin/txout threads going back to genesis and NXTprivacy will have privacyServers that accept payments from multiple senders to the same account.<br /><br />I am not sure what name is best to be used for the private accounts, maybe stealth addresses are close, but the introduction of a trusted server allows for solutions that are different from standard coin mixing. Now each person will select which privacyServer they want to use, including their own. I will be releasing the privacyServer daemon's so that anybody can run one on a VPS. Kind of a decentralized selection of privacyServers, so not technically a pure decentralized solution, but effectively there is nobody you need to trust other than the person who runs the privacyServer. <br /><br />What this means is that people send NXT to your public address and it ends up in a private address that only you and your privacyServer knows. So, you can then spend from the private address privately.<br /><br />Also, I am creating more of an architecture which can always add zerocash to create the 100% private solution<br /><br />James

					MGW servers are up and running and fully synchronized<br />Some major changes to the withdraw processing, so maybe it is totally broken?<br /><br />Anyway, plz spot test the troublesome cases, eg. gremlin amounts, withdrawing to deposit address.<br /><br />If it still handles the basics while fixing the bugs, then I can push forward to dramatically speeding up the withdraws. I will also put some checks in to make sure the bitcoin tx is accepted by the network before publishing an AM that money was sent to bitcoin wallet. I think we will have to get hit with a bit of a delay as undoing things is quite tricky and since we have to wait anyway, might as well wait<br /><br />So, I hope it will survive a NXT core rescan, but not really possible to force that without deleting blockchain...<br />I think I found the two cases that led to mismatched balances, fixed on and the other is the locally accepted but globally rejected bitcoin tx.<br /><br />James

I think I might have fixed the gremlin problem, so next version please test the cases that lost a satoshi<br />2. I reworked the whole process of getting new blocks with checks for rescanning and not going backwards, etc. You can probably simulate this by just forcing a redownload of NXT blockchain locally. If it survives locally without going crazy, good chance it will be fine server side<br />3a. I fixed the withdraw to deposit address case, very tricky it was<br />3b. Still need to figure out a sane way to deal with bitcoind tx that are successful locally but fail to get accepted by the nextwork. Very messy<br />4. I am going to punt on this for now, it is not quite setup for this, so hopefully the GUI can clear the password for sessions&nbsp; that dont want it saved. It is only in memory<br /><br />a) I fixed some API glitches for longzai<br />b) I made it load a lot faster, now ~10 minutes to restart MGW servers. You will have to delete your BTC.cache file in the backups directory (also LTC.cache) to get full benefit of the speedup<br />c) I now wait a minimum of 5 NXT blocks before even looking at the transactions in a block. The plan is to have a safe amount of waiting until the network proves it is healthy. Still need to get all the stats reported to poolserver so MGW can dynamically adapt the number of confirmations it will require.<br /><br />I need to get the current codebase totally bug free before attempting the mass speedup on the withdraw side. That will require quite a revision. <br />I added more NXT to MGW1, that is the server that had to deal with the evil one's mass requests and it ran out of NXT! This made all functions that required AM or asset xfer to fail for just that server, just after it ran out of NXT. I now put error checks in there to just exit if it is out of funds. This will also happen for clients, so make sure you have your acct funded.<br /><br />Still tracking down a case that prevents the servers from catching up as fast as they should. Good news is that without any code changes, just a few restarts and all MGW did get back in sync, so the blockchains as MGW database seems to be working pretty good. Now I just need to make it so it never needs a restart!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. MGW servers are up and then they are down as I continue debugging, so if it is not responsive it is probably cuz I stopped it to debug

Or else just use referencedTransaction=&quot;first_tx&quot; on all transactions after the first one.<br /><br />Regarding the subtype/type issue. That gave me another thought. We are using the AMs for passing technical information, and I'm sure others will as well. This is probably not what the average user wants to see when he opens his message tab.

Your solution is cleaner than mine as there is no doubt which tx are part of dividends. Just need to make sure you can actually do the referenced tx properly<br /><br />you are free to ask for a new tx type from core guys. Usually takes a few months to get it, sometimes longer, sometimes never. Most users wont be looking at AM's sent to the issuer of their assets, not sure there is any problem using AM<br />you are free to ask

By monetizing the extra feature of InstantDEX funding and keeping normal MGW &lt;-&gt; NXT AE at crazy low non-profit prices, it really helps NXT grow, but still MGW can make nice profits. In any case the more deposits in NXT AE, the more possible InstantDEX activity, so it does all make sense to essentially give away the basic MGW service<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S.I dont think I announced here that I figured out how to make the withdrawal side go 100 times faster. That was the one weak technical point, so now both deposit and withdraw sides will be able to scale regardless of how many customers MGW gets

I never liked having to pay for deposit/withdraw at exchnges, but I dont mind paying a reasonable percentage of trades that I do. With InstantDEX there wont be fees for changing bids, but you do need to get some InstantDEX credits and MGW is the perfect way to deal with this. so, MGW instead of trying to make money on normal deposit/withdraw, will get a percentage of InstantDEX fundings<br /><br />I think this is easily 10 times more revenue potential for MGW than increasing fees for withdraws<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I dont want to formally announce this yet as I dont quite have all the MGW &lt;-&gt; InstantDEX connections hooked up.So, I have been thinking about the MGW profitability
