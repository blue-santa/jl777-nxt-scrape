					If there are no bugs in the prunable system and there are no datacenter disasters and no unexpected edge cases arise, then in theory MGW can just switch over from permanent messages.<br /><br />However, I am literally working 18hrs a day and behind on instantdex, pangea and peggy and I simply do not have any time to deal with getting another iteration of MGW done.<br /><br />The idea of going from blockchain to store the data to the MGW nodes plus public archive nodes is an interesting idea and theoretically it is a step toward allowing scalability. However, I do care about customer funds and since I do not have the time to oversee any new revision, unless somebody else takes over the responsibility for MGW code, it will need to stay with permanent data and higher fees.<br /><br />What most people dont understand is that each time I get involved with an incident, it delays my work in other areas. It is not simply a matter to spend X hours and then switch back, if my flow is broken, it might take hours or a day to get back to where I was. And a new MGW release cycle involves a couple weeks of testing, in which I need to be involved in.<br /><br />I simply cannot do it all and I am getting a bit tired and was hoping to be able to lower my daily workings to 12hrs a day, not to increase it to 20hrs per day (which I cant sustain)<br /><br />James

That means the possibility of multiple payments sent out of the MGW and to prevent that would require all sorts of extra work. Also, the withdraws from users could also be forgotten, but that is less likely of a scenario as long as MGW doesnt go down for 2 weeks.<br /><br />The deposit transfer though, that is something that is rescanned from scratch each time the MGW restarts. So if the data is pruned, it will look like a pending deposit that hasnt been paid.<br /><br />Keep in mind these are NXT transactions, not MGW messages, as each MGW message is part of a transaction.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You can simply switch off prunning on your MGW machines. It will work the same way as permanent messages unless all your data is lost in some catastrophe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>and its ok to just lose customer data in such a catastrophe?<br /><br />and there wont ever be any migration to a new server, that maybe is misconfigured and doesnt have the data and then the startup sequence gets confused about phantom pending deposits?<br /><br />So far we have had bitcoind corrupting its DB, data center breaking the relay nodes, and that is just recent history. In the real world things like that happen<br /><br />James

This data is not needed for the blockchain to function, only your software needs it, therefore your software must take care of preserving it. And this has been made exceedingly easy for you, because you only need to change a few nxt.properties in the config file of your servers (servers you control, not public ones) to have them keep this prunable data forever for you, without forcing everyone else to also keep it forever.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">That will open up a lot of new edge cases.

And this retrieval process has been all implemented and tested by the Nxt core developers, who have spent months on that so that projects like yours can afford to be unreliable, have weeks of downtime and keep no backups, yet still be able to restore their data from public archival nodes when needed. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The only practical solution i see if txfees go up is to increase the MGW fee, that is not a problem for me to do.

I think that is uncalled for.<br /><br />BTC blockchain is quite large and each test requires to restart MGW, which scans the BTC data. That takes quite a bit of time. Since you are much better at creating well designed software than me, please tell me how I can make this go faster.<br /><br />Since all MGW servers are running in datacenters, I dont really have control over them. Which means the user's mgw tx data is not protected by the decentralized NXT network. <br /><br />MGW does not use public nodes.<br /><br />And if to use public nodes, I would think there needs to be some contingency to deal with not being able to find the data. THAT is why I do not feel MGW using prunable data is wise. There are much fewer copies of the pruned data, since it is pruned. So a lot higher chance that it cant be found, to the point where I need to specifically deal with such cases. <br /><br />Unless you are advocating that I just trust that there will always be public nodes available with a complete and accurate archive. <br /><br />James

This is the solution, not forcing every node to store MGW messages forever, that only those using MGW need.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>As I posted elsewhere, I do not see how to make MGW reliable while using prunable messages, so any fee increase will have to be passed onto users.<br /><br />With prunable messages, the edge case of an already paid deposit being forgotten as the data needed to make that correlation gets pruned away and cannot be found, will exist. That means the possibility of multiple payments sent out of the MGW and to prevent that would require all sorts of extra work. Also, the withdraws from users could also be forgotten, but that is less likely of a scenario as long as MGW doesnt go down for 2 weeks.<br /><br />The deposit transfer though, that is something that is rescanned from scratch each time the MGW restarts. So if the data is pruned, it will look like a pending deposit that hasnt been paid.<br /><br />Keep in mind these are NXT transactions, not MGW messages, as each MGW message is part of a transaction.<br /><br />James

However the vote goes, it will cost 1/7th as much to change. Surely SuperNet would prefer the cheaper option? Or do you not really care, because you pass the costs onto your users?<br /><br />That said, I would be interested in the rationale for the limit being 160 bytes, rather than, say, 128. Is there some specific use-case it is catering to? Is it the average transaction size (without attachments) - I gather that's usually between 150 and 200 bytes?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Prunable storage of people's deposit/withdraw info?<br /><br />That will open up a lot of new edge cases. I certainly dont want to rely on public servers keeping permanent copies of all such info and there is no guarantee that there would be any such servers with a permanent record<br /><br />so the data needs to be in the permanent data. I keep saying this over and over<br /><br />permanent data and it is part of the asset transfers, so there is no chance of them getting lost.<br /><br />I certainly dont have a month (yes, debugging MGW is very timeconsuming) to code and debug an MGW that uses prunable messages (using remote servers, setting up some internal servers as archive nodes, testing remote retrieval, etc). Even if I had the time, this prunable design would degrade MGW reliability by making it a LOT more complicated than now. Plus it would depend on public servers for proper operations<br /><br />The only practical solution i see if txfees go up is to increase the MGW fee, that is not a problem for me to do. I will just charge 10NXT txfee for each MGW tx, which would cover the worst case costs and a bit extra<br /><br />James

Furthermore, if it is a matter of a few more weeks only, we can encode two different hard fork blocks in the same release, so that shuffling and other new features for example get enabled on Jan 5th, the fee increase and size limit changes take effect on Jan 15th.<br /><br />It is not the difference between 160 and 200 bytes, it is the difference between 200 and 32 bytes. I want the MGW team to make the switch to prunable, even if it means extra work, and even possibly doing a two stage hard fork as described above.<br /><br />Ever since the prunable feature was released in April, I have repeatedly stated that projects like MGW should migrate to it, yet they kept ignoring this. I have no doubt that if we let them use 200 bytes permanent AMs, MGW will plan to use permanent forever, and to save themselves a few weeks of work (and grepping through the code to add a parameter, even if in many places, doesn't take weeks), they will not care if this causes blockchain bloat for everyone else using the platform. Tragedy of the commons.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>MGW uses the blockchain as its permanent record of deposits and withdraws. My understanding is that using prunable transactions means it disappears after 2 weeks.<br /><br />How would you suggest to correlate the transactions made if the data is pruned away?<br /><br />So it is not a matter of changing API calls. By using the blockchain, the user transactions are there, regardless of what happens to the servers. MGW recalculates balances by scanning the blockchain for all transactions, you know, like a blockchain.<br /><br />I am confused why you keep advocating MGW use prunable data. Where should I store the user transactions info. These are part of the deposit/withdraws so there is no chance of them being separated and lost. Once we start storing the user transaction data in any other place than the actual transaction, then it loses the blockchain aspect it has.<br /><br />Any fee increase will need to be passed on to end users as MGW fees are not covering costs as it is.<br /><br />James

Given the mud that's been slung around here the past few days, he doesn't want to make a personal appearance right now but wanted to clear up a few things:<br /><br />Backwards compatibility is obviously a huge issue for maintaining working software. There's a lot of understandable upset around that whole situation still, but the bottom line is that without it, some functionality will end up moving to BTCD. James will be working on that now. Bc on Nxt may or may not be a resolvable issue - that's very uncertain at the moment. That is a dialogue that needs to continue within the community. <br /><br />As has always been the case, Nxt will remain the financial platform for SuperNET, so all the jl777 assets will continue to be hosted on Nxt. <br /><br />The sell walls have been pulled, except for one at 7500 NXT/BTC. [If that works out we're all doing ok.] James wanted to convey that he was very upset and this was the only way he had of communicating that in a way that would be understood by the community, but that the intent was not to sell NXT.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>thanks for summarizing. I am also still having connection issues so have problems getting logged in. I did need to raise some funds due to unexpected costs, but that has been taken care of.<br /><br />And for those who say that I should just fix my code, well let me explain that it is not that I am unwilling to. It is simply that I am not skilled enough to. If you think it is easy to write cutting edge crypto software (it isnt), then try to do it when anything and everything you do can be changed. So without a time machine, it is not possible.<br /><br />If you know anybody that can, let me know, I will hire him.<br /><br />So the alternative is for me to create an independent virtualization directly on top of the blockchain and low level network, but I cannot find the documentation to do this, nor do I have any free time to do it. I did exactly this with bitcoin/btcd in the last couple days, so I am busy creating the mass market solutions. Maybe I will have time to create a stable virtualization layer for NXT someday, but this seems like a lot of extra work, especially since that is what the API is for.<br /><br />Thanks to chanc3r who is identifying specific issues that will need to be addressed to make sure MGW keeps working. With his efforts, this appears to be in a good state.<br /><br />Due to the somewhat hostile environment here, I find it counterproductive to actively follow the forum, it feels a lot like BTT sometimes. I am trying to help NXT as best as I can, but at this point my hands are tied. I am sorry that I am not technically good enough to solve this, so I will concentrate on solving the things that I can.<br /><br />Like a scalable and easy to use blockchain solution in a chrome app<br /><br />James

With the lite nodes being popular and using the public nodes, this is not something that can be controlled.<br /><br />You dont seem to understand that it is impossible to anticipate future changes in existing API and also that it is impossible to get the already installed software on the decentralized nodes to be updated prior to any such event. Even with notification, without months of deprecation period it prevents using NXT as a platform.<br /><br />Would you respect the community's vote on this issue of backward compatibility?<br />I estimate it would take very little time to revert to the old default settings and that would fix dozens of API that were broken with the 1.6<br /><br />James

SuperNET will incur a delay to remove its NXT dependency, but it will certainly not die from not depending on NXT, rather my assessment is that it is more likely to die if it depends on NXT that is guaranteed to not be backward compatible

We had a proposal for a workaround using a filter, supplying different default parameter values based on configuration in nxt.properties, but this was not considered useful by the SuperNet team so I am not going to implement it. There is no other feasible technical solution. All clients of the APIs that are affected by the changes must be updated, and we will document in details which APIs have been changed to make that easier. There will be no reversal in 1.6.3.<br /><br />The 1.6.1e changelog did have an &quot;incompatible changes&quot; section, and the rest of the incompatible changes were also included in the 1.6.2 changelog, but now we realize that in practice this is not sufficient. To improve communication to potentially affected parties, we plan to setup mailing lists for such notifications, and make sure to announce important changes as early as pratically possible in the future.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There was no discussion with the SuperNET team about the 1.6.2 breaking all the installed base. The only &quot;discussion&quot; happened after I complained about it not being backward compatible. And this &quot;discussion&quot; was basically a confirmation that the promise of backward compatibility that was made last year is not being honored.<br /><br />There have been many customer support issues due to the breaking of the API and a lot of unreported cases where the customers just stop using SuperNET (and NXT)<br /><br />I have been assured that with each NXT release that there will likely NOT be any backward compatibility of the API, which means anything that uses it will likely break and need unknown amounts of testing, requalification and of course customer support and field update issues.<br /><br />It is not possible to deploy a large scale system using a &quot;platform&quot; that isnt backward compatible due to the breaking of all the ALREADY installed and running systems. With decentralized systems it is not possible for centrally force an update on users. Just look at some of the versions NXT peers are still running. Therefore anything that is guaranteed to break is certainly not worth spending marketing dollars to acquire the installed base for.<br /><br />The NXT devs lack a fundamental understanding about business reality and I am extremely disappointed in the breaking of the promise to keep things backward compatible. The ONLY exception is if there is an attack vector. Local node performance is not any excuse.<br /><br />Due to this, I am rethinking my reliance on NXT for SuperNET. I have quite a lot of code that takes all my time to create and to be assured that I will have to keep reworking it forever due to backward compatibility breaking with each release. This is not practical for me.<br /><br />So, NXT will have a more efficient API with much fewer users. That is the effect of this breaking of the backward compatibility promise. <br /><br />Anyway, the first effect of all this is that ALL of my projects will be delayed. I will wait for NXT API to stabilize before I waste my time. The most likely scenario is that I will just remove all dependency on NXT and put whatever functions I need into BTCD.<br /><br />James<br /><br />tl:dr it is a MAJOR breach of trust as far as I am concerned that the API backward compatibility promise has been violated and I cannot rely on NXT for any important SuperNET functions.
