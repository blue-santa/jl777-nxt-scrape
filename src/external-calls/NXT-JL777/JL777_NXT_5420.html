Will all the miners voluntarily leave the pool that is cheating and thus increasing their revenues?

Or were brainwashed by it.<br /><br />There is no 51% attack I am aware of that can drain an account. The worst that happens is that everything stops. OK that is pretty bad, but there is no incentive for people who already control vast amounts of NXT to do that. With bitcoin a 33% attack is possible. NXT is immune to the selfish miner attack, so right there it is superior<br /><br />As far as jealous people not adopting NXT if it get big and makes a few people zillion of dollars, that is crazy illogic. How does NXT get so big if people are not adopting it bigtime? So it is a dumb argument<br /><br />Now, the founders won the lottery. They were lucky, they admit it. This does not mean that new people cant earn a lot of NXT. I seem to have done allright and I started with a bunch of worthless altcoins that I sold off for NXT. Then I sold all my BTC. Then my car and house and put everything into NXT. I worked hard and it paid off.<br /><br />Thats something like what the American dream used to be. It is possible. I did it.<br /><br />So if NXT is so horrible how come it is so amazingly good?<br /><br />James

I understand that the founder produced a lot of research into transparent forging so that people would one day be comfortable investing in a coin where 50% is owned by a very small amount of people.<br /><br />I have high hopes for Nxt but I like to be realistic at the same time.<br /><br />Nxt is semi-serious business, we need to figure out a way to distribute these types of coins fairly.<br /><br />To give an example. If Nxt overtook Bitcoin and become a large trillion dollar currency, (what bitcoin aspires to be). Then it's likely the top 10 investors in Nxt would be worth 600-800 billion. That type of distribution will never be taken seriously.

I am studying the getState output and I think there will be away to make a function that given two peer's getState outputs,it will return a probability that they are on the same fork<br /><br />I doubt we can ever get 100% accuracy, so we would need to scale the acceptable percentage of time we are wrong with the size of the transaction.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S.

Not saying they are doing anything illegal, but maybe hiring a bunch of shills to spread FUD all over the place, stuff like that. Visa/MC hired lobbyists and a few weeks later there is a congressional investigation about illegal activities and bitcoin. stuff like that<br /><br />I mean it was obvious to me the moment I discovered NXT that it is the next big thing. But so much disinformation and the same disinformation, almost like there was a specific set of talking points. Coincidence, maybe, but just because I am paranoid doesnt mean they arent after me.

I know this means that nobody can purchase all the NXT assets, ever, so it is kind of immunity against financial attack on NXT assets, but does anybody else find this a little confusing?<br /><br />How can NXT have NXT assets such that the sum of the NXT assets values are well in excess of a billion NXT. Wouldnt this cause a dramatic shortage of NXT. Currently we are well below this mark, but I predict in a few months we will cross that threshold. And there is nothing that stops more and more assets from being issued. The total asset values could well exceed 100 billion NXT down the road. <br /><br />I predict at that point, the scarcity of NXT (assuming 1% of assets per day trade) will lead to a critical shortage of NXT. The &quot;problem&quot; is that the spike in NXT price will attract more asset issuers making the problem worse. It feedsback on itself...<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think there is a problem with your reasoning, unless I misunderstand the way the AE works.<br />The way I see things is that the value of assets is only referred to in Nxt, but it doesn't mean the Nxt equivalent would be drained from the monetary mass.<br />Let me explain : If I want to buy Anon's silver at market price (around $600 per kilogram), I'll need to spend 20000 Nxt per kg. Let's suppose someone sells that to me. 20k Nxt move from my account to his and I get the corresponding tokens, which are like a proof of my ownership, the silver being stored in Anon's basement (where does he live, by the way ? <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" />). Once the seller receives his Nxt, he'll exchange them with dollars, for example, and then buy some more silver. We can then redo the same operation, over and over, and, technically, all other things being equal, I could buy myself 55 tons of silver with Nxt's current market cap.<br />But there would still be Nxt being used, because the Nxt &quot;coins&quot; are not stored in Anon's basement, only the silver is. As a matter of fact, the monetary mass will not have changed at all. That's why it's called a &quot;currency&quot; : It keeps moving.<br />And, in the end, I could discuss this with Anon and ask him to send me the silver I'm entitled to, and sell it in euros, for example, without&nbsp; going through the AE again. In &amp; out...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It is not a problem until the percentage of (1 billion NXT) / (total assets value) &lt; (percentage of assets that trade daily)<br />Maybe daily can be changed to hourly, so we are a long ways away from any NXT scarcity driven price spike. After thinking about it a bit, I realized it is self correcting. Having the formula made it more apparent. The price of NXT will simply increase so that there is enough to deal with the trading liquidity required.<br /><br />So change my estimate to a few years away from this event<br /><br />James

Of course, there are things like zero coupon bonds that pay no interest and just lump sum at the end,but lets stick to the model of a security that costs X and in return you will get sum(Y0 + Y1 + ... ) where Yi is the value of what you get each year. Clearly the time horizon is critical as without a cutoff it will become infinite, which is clearly wrong.&nbsp; So, an approximation is made where you take one years worth of profits and multiply it by this PE (price earnings multiplier)<br /><br />Companies that are in mature competitive industries get the lowest PE, companies that are in high growth high profitability industries get the highest multiples. PEs in the multiple hundreds are possible for premium companies like google before they have taken over the world. The market projects how big they will be and how much profits they will be making in the future, discount it for competitive and unknown factors and decides on what the PE should be.<br /><br />Here in crypto land we can safely assume is is going to be high growth industry, so the multiples should be more than an old steel factory. Now there are plenty of risks, especially for longevity, so lets throw out the triple digit PE. More than single digits, less than three digits. I think a reasonable PE would be 20. That is super low for a mega growth industry,but it also factors in the risk. Basically it should be more like 50, 60 or 80 but since things are so new and unproven, I discount things to the more typical PE of 20. It means 20 years of constant profits. But of course, with exponential growth you can hit that in 3 years or so.<br /><br />Since we are analyzing the price of an asset, lets simplify things by taking the total holdings and dividing by the total number of assets. For example at this moment:<br /><br />NXTventure: ~3 million NXT, ~350000 NXTautoDAC, ~200000 NXTventure<br />just look up acct 9190137219092766242 to get the totals. There are one million assets, so this becomes:<br />3 NXT, .35 NXTautoDAC, .2 NXTventure<br /><br />The market is still discovering the price of NXTautoDAC. I knew 10 NXT was below market and it is already at 14/15, lets round down and say NXTautoDAC is worth 14 so .35 of that is 4.9 NXT. NXTventure itself is at somewhere between 16 and 31. I dont count the selfbid. Call it 24, so .2 of that is 4.8 NXT<br /><br />Add the three together and the marked to market holdings of NXTventure is 12.7<br />This might be analogous to book value. Not actual market value but the number accountants use for tax purposes where you want to have smaller numbers. Also, fundamental investors like to use this as a sort of worst case value. Keep in mind it is not the actual book value, just a marked to market value. The thinking is that if the company just distributed itself out 100% to its holders what is it worth. My estimate is 12.7, round down to 12<br /><br />What that means is that if the price is 24, half of that is covered by the marked to market + cash value. So the question now becomes is NXTventure properly valued at 24?<br /><br />Lets see, working backwards using a PE of 20, what this means is that the market is saying that it thinks that in a year NXTventure will produce 12/20 NXT in additional profits per asset. Hmmm. Thats 600,000 NXT of profits for the whole next 12 months. Do you think that is right?<br /><br />OK, lets go the other way. Let us assume that each month NXTventure will be able to earn 1 NXT per asset in trading profits + assets. That means that over a year the price of 24 means that the PE is 1. ONE? PE of 1. Now I know of some low margin companies that sell for PS (price to total sales not profits) of 2 or 3, but PE of 1 is extremely low.<br /><br />I really cant give investment advice regarding my own assets and you need to get an independent analysis, preferably your own. However, NXTventure is fairly unique because unlike other growth companies that dont issue dividends, there will be a monthly dividend of that month's listing. The price should zig zag around the ex-dividend date. Let us assume there will be .3 NXTautoDAC per asset at the end of the month and that the price is 15. Well if the first month's dividend is worth 4.5 NXT, what would you estimate the annual amount of dividends to be? What PE do you think NXTventure should get?<br /><br />Once you objectively analyze this question and do the calculations, you will have a big advantage over the people that dont since you will know how much it is worth, well at least a lot closer than the people that dont do the analysis<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I know I cant give any advice about my assets, but I think I can say that I strongly feel that NXTventure is the most undervalued one of them all, if you were to compare them against each other.

I am sure glad I dont live in usa! What an electronic police state it has become.<br /><br />both irs and other govt branch admitted that they have no problems in identifying money flows through the traceable protocol (meaning bitcoin)<br />NXT is currently just as traceable, however fundamentally NXT is much, much superior to all the other cryptos for anonymity.The reason is that it doesnot have txout/txin history attached to each bitcoin.<br />this means that as soon as NXT is commingled in the same acct, there is only statistical, timing and knapsack analysis that can be used.<br /><br />Well,thats not so comforting until you realize that with synchronized broadcasting of identical sized transactions into the mixing acct, it eliminates timing and knapsack analysis,so if you follow the right process, the statistical correlation can be iterated away to noise level.<br /><br />After my current projects (or sooner if I can find a dev to help) I will do NXT anonymity system. It will not be a single approach,but a combined approach. I will donate this to the community, no fees, no profit making company. This is not an option, it is something that is required. We used to have cash,now that is disappearing. I just want to recreate the characteristics of cash!<br /><br />Also, when it is distributed, profitless, and pervasive there is no place for it to be attacked.<br /><br />James

Can you explain why Darkcoin is exploding at the moment? I know anonymity is important for crypto but what's the point about that anonymous as Darkcoin wants to implement it? Doesn't the philosophy of Darkcoin makes Darkcoin a safe haven for criminals? Maybe I didn't understand it correctly but I don't see the use for average people. People that are threathened by criminals or political reasons will use Tor or simlar software anyway, right? Is Darkcoin more anonymous than e.g. NXT + Tor?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>new irs rules appear to require disclosure of every bitcoin tx<br />this means usa is totally deanonymizing the bitcoin addresses<br />they will be able to map all bitcoin addresses with significant funds to a social security number<br /><br />plus darkcoin sounds so cool!
