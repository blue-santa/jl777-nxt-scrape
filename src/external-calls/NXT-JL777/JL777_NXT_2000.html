So if a public server is compromised, this is no good.<br /><br />What I need is an algo that seeds the public server's statistics tables in a way that guarantees (nearly) that it will be able to route to the proper destination, but without any high confidence level as to which of the N nodes it was. So if the tail of the histogram is too long, then the routing failure goes up, the the histogram tail is too short, then the anon set of possible IP addresses is getting too small<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. The degenerate case is to use a loopback server (which is trustable since it is your own computer) and only establish strong statistical signal with it. Maybe it is as simple as that? Then the statistical correlation by other nodes will have a stronger correlation to your loopback privacyserver as all packets are routed from it, but people wont know if you are using a loopback privacy server or some external public privacy server

How big of a tree will it grow into? this is the question. I do not know what type of tree it is. Put in realworld terms, the marketcap is &lt;$200K USD. <br />This is the marketcap for some local dry cleaning store, not a tech asset with global reach and a growing happy userbase.<br /><br />How will MGW monetize the userbase? This is something for the community to figure out. I have some ideas, but I think it is time for others to figure out how to do such things also.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Hint: the best monetization is one that is part of a natural process that the users are not really noticing and easily accepting as a good value.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As a user, the value is very clear, as I really enjoy using it.&nbsp; As an investor, I'm not sure.&nbsp; Most revenues from tech companies that purport to be &quot;free&quot; (Facebook, Google, Twitter), have been monetized by ad revenue or selling information to marketers, which clearly doesn't seem to be an option.&nbsp; Every user that contributes by trading with MGW provides liquidity and encourages more users, but that doesn't directly produce a revenue stream.&nbsp; How do we move that value of liquidity back to investors of MGW without a fee hike?&nbsp; Can't answer that right now, but it seems to be the question at hand.&nbsp; It seems like it has to be some sort of external input.&nbsp; Maybe sell some sort of interface API to exchanges that want to utilize this.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be great, charge the exchanges instead of the exchanges charing us <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />! But honestly, that's my best guess right now, not sure business is my game.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>At current levels of usage, there isnt a lot of support incidents, but still enough to take up meaningful amounts of my time. So if MGW charged users a support fee for each ticket, then this would discourage people from making a support request after 9 blocks and their tx is not there yet. While if something goes wrong it isnt really good incentive structure to be charging users, but I dont think most users would mind paying some small fee for faster support. The patient people wouldnt be forced to pay anything extra, but if there is a queue to get support, what if customers could pay extra to get to the front of the line?<br /><br />This creates a market driven price for support services. Just one idea. I am sure there are more ways, but these ideas will take some effort to develop. For now growing the userbase is really all that matters, getting some few extra dollars is not what it is about. Now when there are 100,000 users using MGW directly and indirectly, the question is if on average there can be MGW fees of 0.1 penny per day per user. This fraction of penny translates to a PE based valuation far in excess of the current $150K marketcap.<br /><br />So the question is how to generate an average of 0.1 penny per day per user.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Another idea I just got is to offer MGW escrow service. The going rate for escrow is quite high, so this would be quite a bit more than 0.1 penny per user and would not take much effort to make the tech for it,

Onion routing is a method for sending data from one place to another by bouncing the data across multiple servers with multiple layers of encryption. <br />Process:<br />1. the data to send is encrypted on multiple levels by the client<br />2. the client sends the encrypted packet to the first of many PrivacyServers<br />3. the privacy server does checks on the packet<br />4. the server then decrypts the packet one level <br />5. the server checks if the packet is now completely decrypted and meant for this location<br />6. If it still has layers of encrytion to go, it locates a new privacy server to send to and repeats the process<br />7. once the packet reaches the end user, the data is available, seemingly untractably and anonymously <br /><br />Faults to work out:<br />- the packets could be monitored for size and followed by tracing the unique size of the packet through the network<br />A) ~ mitigated by either padding the values to max or adding a random salt to the packet at each level<br />- the packets could be followed by the timing of each hop<br />B) ~ mitigated by adding random wait times on the system<br />- somehow having a code fault that allows access to previous senders or public keys for other levels or privacy servers<br />C) ~ further code analysis for errors<br /><br />If anyone wants to help find flaws to iron out, your help is appreciated, otherwise this is just a rundown of what supernet can do&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>A) I plan to have a higher privacy level to pad out all packets. Since this adds network bandwidth load, I think it is best to have a &quot;cost&quot;, which will just be the requirement of TBD amount of BTCD to be in the user's acct<br /><br />B) I think assumes the attacker is able to monitor all packet traffic, but the attacker would only be able to decrypt packets that it is routing (or receiving). Unless the traffic level is so low that individual packets can be traced globally, it will be hard to correlate the packets even for a single transmission. this being said, a random delay is a good idea, but probably not such a large range.<br /><br />It is important to note that there are two types of nodes, the public servers that publish their IP addresses and pubkey and the private nodes that only communicate to the public servers. The part I need most help is to see if the probabilistic routing will truly shield a private node's IP address from the public servers, and of course whether it will be able to successfully route most of the time.<br /><br />My feeling is that based on network topology different fanout levels need to be used in addition to some integration of historical probabilities. When the network is relatively small, we an err on the side of larger values, but at the larger scale it will be important to be as efficient as possible. One approach I am thinking of is to just use an adaptively adjusted fanout factor, eg. shrink it if it worked, expand it if it didnt. this would end up jittering around the optimum level and once there is enough history to add a bit of headroom to the critical value.<br /><br />It would be nice if somebody could model this<br /><br />James<br />

Additionally, I plan to provide additional revshare for the trades that involve MGW assets (and uMGW assets), the idea is to provide funding proportional to contribution to the ecosystem. The exact formulas are not set in stone yet.<br /><br />Also, it is easily possible that one day a new monetization idea for MGW will get implemented that will have the userbase already in place.<br /><br />So, MGW at 1/10'th InstantDEX revenue valuation is a minimum price floor for MGW valuation. The other part is the proportional contribution which should be some meaningful percentage of the baseline. Then the value of the happy users of MGW, which is actually the largest value in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything is still at the early stage just past the seed stage, so it is just sprouting roots. How big of a tree will it grow into? this is the question. I do not know what type of tree it is. Put in realworld terms, the marketcap is &lt;$200K USD. <br />This is the marketcap for some local dry cleaning store, not a tech asset with global reach and a growing happy userbase.<br /><br />How will MGW monetize the userbase? This is something for the community to figure out. I have some ideas, but I think it is time for others to figure out how to do such things also.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Hint: the best monetization is one that is part of a natural process that the users are not really noticing and easily accepting as a good value.

This is true for almost any market other than forex, which has nearly infinite supply and demand.<br /><br />So, I think your site is making some pretty unrealistic assumptions by representing this dump everything right now as the value that you post as the official value. Maybe have a &quot;time&quot; and/or &quot;volume&quot; setting with some reasonable assumptions. After all most people have less than 1% of an asset, so what value is showing the liquidation value of 100% of the assets?<br /><br />If someone is selling 0.1% of an asset, then calculate what they get for it, that would seem to have value. As it is liquidation of all assets will clear the orderbooks of all assets so this will create a much lower &quot;value&quot; that what is real. You do want to show something that relates to reality, dont you?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1. yes, perhaps or perhaps not. you describe trading and the result of liquidate/selling an asset in full is exactly the value you get when converted to cash at a time of need means, <strong>your value now</strong>.<br />2. how that? a flash crash is not possible within nxt ae if you liquidate your asset(s) at once. i think you are mixing things up here. there are existing order you can fill or not. nxt ae is an order matching<br />engine. if you set an ask below the deepest indicated bid level for your asset you get a match and fill at once in full. please explain how there can be a flash crash. the other way around, your approach<br />would generate one.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>if the algorithm you are using is to fill all the orders on the orderbook, there is usually some guy who bids 0.000001 NXT for all the assets and you will use this bid as part of the official calculation.<br /><br />just seems artificial and not realistic, but if you are happy with this and want to have your site displaying such unrealistic numbers, you are free to do so. The fact that it wont have meaning to anybody other than the asset whales who dont tend to dump into .000001 bids, limits its usefulness. but what do I know, maybe everybody is so keen to find out such worst case numbers<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />wow, let me summarize. you say to use the current real and existing orders to value a portfolio, which can be filled are unrealistic but assuming a slow sell at highest bid<br />would reflect the real value for a portfolio because bids filling up again at this best sell level and moreover this slow sell approach wouldn't have negative impact to the price<br />compared to a clean full fill?<br /><br />well, i am sure now we are talking about two different things here and what the definition for a serious portolio valuation is and yes, i will stick with this approach simple because i am in reality when it<br />comes to numbers or you could say - i want to know what i get, when i am in the need to get. not later, not perhaps. not theoretical but now and for sure.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>you have ignored my suggestion for having a volume parameter, that would at least lend some value to this liquidation valuation you have. you imply that you own 100% of many assets if you are wanting to &quot;know what I get&quot; and without a volume parameter you are assuming 100% liquidation of the entire orderbook and if there are not enough bids using 0.00000000 NXT as the value as that is all you can be sure you will get.<br /><br />i will make a note not to use your site for any asset valuations

After 720 blocks, the blockchain is set. These original keys will only have value if they still have the NXT in them.<br /><br />The way I understand it if you had a zillion funded accts, then you can be forging on all these accts, but this requires a zillion NXT. Maybe now it is possible to forge with less than 1 NXT, if so maybe we should make it so any acct with less than 1 NXT cannot forge? Otherwise you could make zillions of accts that are forging.<br /><br />James
