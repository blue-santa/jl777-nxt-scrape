He collected millions of nxt by releasing I don't know dozens of assets (I wasn't keeping count).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I would like to think that your posts have somewhat accurate information and you are usually a smart guy, so it is confusing when you post something that is so far from reality. I usually ignore such posts as there is not much point in responding, but I represent a lot of asset holders and if erroneous statements like this go without response, some people might get the wrong idea. So I am taking time out of my precious MGW debugging time to deal with this.<br /><br />TEAM has dozens of people working together on&nbsp; a handful of operating companies. Also, InstantDEX and NXTcoinsco were created well before AE was launched and around 5 million NXT was put into them before NXT AE was launched. NXTautoDAC is managed by bluemeanie, and the nxthaus/bithaus was a passthru asset. Oh, yes, my evil scheme of finding the market price of MGW to be 5 to 7 NXT and discounting it to 2.5 and selling ~15% and giving away the rest so I only have 10% of MGW. I also found everybody that paid more than 2.5 and bonused them MGW assets so their effective price was 2.5 or below.<br /><br />I count only six operating assets (if you consider NXTventure an operating company) I issued that people bought on AE and two that are proxy assets, eg. jl777hodl and sharkfund0. Can you help me find the missing dozens of assets? Are you talking about nodecoin, bannercoin and the BTC, LTC, etc assets? I am only planning on a total of half a dozen of those types of assets. Or are you complaining about assets I have issued and not sold any assets on AE. <br /><br />You seem to be implying that assets in general and mine specifically have no value. Curious as to how you would analyze the value of sharkfund0? The majority of asset sales went into sharkfund0 and it is 100% backed by marked to the market values of things like, BTC, NXT, DRK, etc. Are you saying that you think the cryptos have no value or are you saying that I am lying about the holdings in the accounts? It has the equivalent of ~20 million NXT in crypto assets, the vast vast majority from the most liquid cryptos that exist.<br /><br />You keep saying I deliver nothing. I posted 17000+ lines of custom C code that is forming NXTservices. I even make a dividend calculator for all asset holders based on this codebase. I suppose this has no value either because all assets have no value?<br /><br />You know, sometimes I really dont like what you say. At least the original emule was kind of funny. <br /><br />If you would have preferred a universe where there was no jl777 that created 1800 BTC of trading volume in the first days of NXT AE, why dont you just join the mastercoin camp? They have very few assets to complain about. XCP does have a few more though.<br /><br />I have not even kept track of the millions of NXT in asset values that I have given away, I think it is around twenty million NXT worth. Of course you will say none of it has any value, even though I could be selling a little bit daily for NXT. I am doing the reverse. I am using the NXT that I earned and purchasing assets that I feel have good people behind them and that is the most important thing to me, good people, because good people do good things.<br /><br />For the record, I was the one that actively pushed and saved the 9 million NXT from incineration, and this led to the creation of marketing, tech and infrastructure funds. Again, no value here?<br /><br />I also privately raised nearly 3 million NXT for the NXTcommunityfund and I think about half has been already disbursed (none of them to me). Again, no value here?<br /><br />Eadequa, please give me a report card. You would give me what a C-? worse?<br /><br />Remember I am just one guy, a generalist, I do full spectrum of tasks. One of them is coding a bunch of stuff because NOBODY volunteered to help or even let me pay them to code it. So I decided it was more efficient if I just coded it myself, even though I dont know java. I am just a simple C programmer.<br /><br />Before I started coding I proposed a set of layered services to be built. People like you kept telling me to stop talking nonsense, etc. I got the message, so instead of talking about it, I started building it. It is not done yet, but soon we will start getting initial deployments. Have you helped with testing any of my releases?<br /><br />I am doing the best I can. I have given away a significant chunk of what I could have kept for myself personally. I found it distressing that Wesley who has made the wonderful GUI had very little NXT. I gave him equal assets to me in InstantDEX. At least now as NXT succeeds, Wesley will have a nice amount of NXT value. I felt that for the good of NXT, it was important to get as many key people fully vested with NXT. Now we have dozens of people (not assets) who will all be able to get millions of NXT when their projects are completed and it starts generating revenues. Again, the value of creating the fifth largest crypto organization in the world (after BTC, NXT, ripple, etherium) is probably zero in your eyes.<br /><br />Hopefully, the other primary asset issuers will follow my lead and grant big huge chunks of their assets to they key contributors. This is for the good of NXT.<br /><br />I am proud that I was involved in some way with 8 of the top 10 issues during the first days of AE that generated 90% of the trading volume. People kept saying how NXT is unfair because some 73 lucky people got 50 million NXT for 1 BTC (actually only 8 did, the rest put in much less). In the last six months I have worked literally over 2000 hours on NXT. I now have around 10% of what a full BTC founder got and the vast majority of that I put into sharkfund. I think it is worth noting that I have put in around 500BTC of gains I made from my &quot;lucky&quot; trades into sharkfund, so the majority of my liquid assets have been created external to NXT. I could have worked 2000 hours at $100/hr and made $200,000, and that probably would have been worth more than whatever I have created/earned/luckedinto so far. However, i am very happy with my decision as for every detractor there are dozens of jl777 supporters. This helps me immensely<br /><br />The NXT community is stuck with me for quite a few years as the vast majority of the market cap I created is not liquid. That means me and the dozens in TEAM will all have to work very hard for months if not years to grow NXT, before we have the ability to cash in. <br /><br />For the record I have no desire to cash in as working in NXT is usually quite fun and challenging, plus I personally feel that long term everything in the NXT universe now will be looked back on as those early days when everything was so cheap.<br /><br />I am a passionate person and when I am personally attacked, it really affects me and after all this, I have a hard time switching back to coding. So MGW release will have to be delayed by a day more. If that was your intent, congratulations, you succeeded. If you want to show that you actually want NXT to succeed, why dont you help testing my releases. I would imagine it would give you a kick to be able to post all the millions of bugs I must have in my code.<br /><br />James

You all know the ONLY reason you want this woman there. She doesn't even know about NXT. I'm all for new Nxters - but to represent us at a show that is almost too big for us? Please how much time did we debate here about who to send - panicked even when we thought Cointropolis might not be able to do it?<br /><br />Listen, I've been in advertising since the 80's. I know what this is about. And FYI, I've even been the eye candy. This is not where we want to go. You want to close deals about Nxt with&nbsp; businesses based on the merits of what? That a girl can play a game of chess? So, what? That she can speak several languages? I had a maid once who was fluent in five. It didn't qualify her for very much. That we have a woman that can cozy up after the show? Hostess? Come on! You all know we've got gregarious, friendly geniuses in Cointropolis. Again. You KNOW what this is about. And I can't support it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My guess is that she can learn about NXT pretty quickly. Its not like payexpo attendees are going to be asking about in depth forging algo questions<br />Arent we going to be understaffed?<br />You are against having somebody that can help out with the tradeshow to explain basic NXT functions?<br />I am confused<br />I am not proposing that she gives the keynote speech or pretends to be a NXT dev.<br />trade show, lots of people, asking very basic questions<br /><br />how many people will be at this show that we are paying so much for?<br />

Kasparov gave her his contact to keep in touch.<br /><br /><br />This is not about this girl. If anyone can bring another girl, who also knows Nxt deeply and can do the job, it would be great and i would support it. I also think its important in this kind of events.<br />&nbsp;In fact im not sure if this isnt too much for my friend, for not having technical knowledge.

But, I guarantee you there are a lot of modern men who wouldn't and there are probably zero women who might be movers and shakers in the world of business who would like it at all. This is not Comic Con.<br /><br />Furthermore, this gimmick is typically employed by vendors at shows who are in a competition with other business and can't stand on their on merits. And that is how it's perceived.<br /><br />So, welcome any woman who is fully qualified to enter into a serious, non-flirtatious dialogue about the nitty gritty of Nxt and I'm all for it! If she is just to look pretty and flirt, I'm 1000% against it.<br /><br />Let's let Nxt shine on it's own merits.<br /><br />Respectfully,<br />Elizabeth<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I feel the same in some way.Why i brought it is because i think she could learn properly what Nxt is about and introduce it as a basic user level, while being nice and capable of speaking in many languages.And because i think she is super smart. I wouldnt put there a no-brain top model.<br /><br />It sucks, but men will always prefer to start talking with a good looking girl,as big as an offense that could be. And it will be the same in a hundred years.<br />To have a fully qualified technical conversation we have other people, mainly devs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I will not debate that &quot;sex sells&quot; even though I wish it weren't the case. But, the companies that employ that premise are globally behind the times.<br /><br />You say you agree, but you still think we should bring the &quot;pretty woman&quot; who would have to learn about Nxt. But, you say, she is &quot;super smart&quot;. Well, there are scores of super smart people on this forum and who have been breathing Nxt from the beginning who would not feel qualified to engage in the required conversations.<br /><br />So, you would leave the serious conversation to the others? Ok, so why is it we should spend money try to train someone who is &quot;somewhere&quot; on the super smart bell curve and send her to stand with the others except for the fact that we don't think the men are pretty enough. Oh. I thought this was about Nxt.<br /><br />&nbsp;*disillusioned sigh* I thought the Nxt Community was more forward thinking than this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What i gave value to, are her abilities as a hostess. By saying super smart i mean she is not the typical no brain - model who cant speak of anything ( who i would also be against of putting there).This girl has been national chess champion amongst many other things, and she isnt a spectacular super model. She is a simple good looking girl, with good social abilities, easy to talk with.Capable of speaking many languages, and of studying anything deep if necessary. She will never know nxt as anyone in this forum does, but&nbsp; she could learn to explain it to introduce it in a simple way to someone who has no idea what Nxt is about.<br /><strong>As i said it was just a proposal</strong>, to add something maybe we will lack. If you think we dont need it, or she should be able to know Nxt as deep as any dev, its fine. End of conversation <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /> <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /><br /><br />What i dont like is saying at first this is something sexist. But whatever....<br />And sometimes you need to bring interest in order to make people listen to you.And im not talking of selling sex, omg. I wont discuss this. If you think this wont be necessary in that expo, its also fine. In fact i wish its like that,it would be great if we are automatically going to have everyone there pay attention to us.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think if you proposed initially that you could get a person who has hosted world famous dignitary like Kasparov could help us at payexpo, it would have been a no brainer. People like that tend to know other influential people. We need more NXTers<br /><br />James

What if this girl was a man? Wouldnt we say &quot;Great! The more help we get the better&quot;?<br /><br />So what is happening here is reverse discrimination. We are rejecting out of hand a potentially key new NXTer, because of what? Fear of what other people might think? That NXT gets people who help Kasparov to help them? Do you know who Kasparov is? What if Kasparov would offer to help?<br /><br />Peoples lets use common sense. EVERY new person in NXT helps NXT. If they are intelligent, that is better. If they happen to be nice looking, thats an extra bonus.<br /><br />Am I the only one that isnt biased against women? In my experience, they are used to this and work a lot harder than men. Also, do you know how hard it is to become a chess champion? It takes a lot of hard work.<br /><br />So, if my opinion matters at all, please send her (and Kasparov if we can) to payexpo!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Kasparov is a very famous figure and I think he would really like crypto,eg. NXT. Please get our new chess champion fully up to speed so she can hopefully get Kasparov into NXT

					I made a big mistake yesterday <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br />As you know I had nice bite of XC, but after it went up 500%, I figured I should take some profits. Then unlike my usual partial selling and keeping a chunk, I got a bad feeling about XC. Everything is based on a rumor of an anon functionality. To my knowlege, no src, no public version, so it just felt time to get out and bank the BTC. <br /><br />While it did drop a bit from my exit, it then of course climbed to new highs. 40 BTC that could have been made, or 20BTC if I kept half, wasnt made.<br /><br />Of course the QCN I shifted the BTC to went down a bit, so polo acct balance dropped 15 BTC. QCN is a MRO fork,but they want to make it more user friendly. It also has much fewer coins, so if you believe in MRO, the QCN seemed to be a good bet. At the time, I was using XC gains, so it didnt feel like a heavy decision,but I have to keep reminding myself that every BTC is as valuable as any other, regardless of how it was earned<br /><br />So a hopefully temporary 1% dip on the polo side.<br />Of course, it is better to be lucky than good and in spite of all the logical arguments against my DRK will bounce off of .02 and get back to .025, consolidate a bit for a possible challenge to new high scenario, it seems that is pretty much exactly what DRK did. This is no surprise to me as in the absence of significant news all high volume markets behave this way. Similar to a damped harmonic oscillation. My forex modeling gave me way too many hours of staring at price movement screens. In my efforts to create SVMs to predict the market, I seem to have inadvertently learned too much about this stuff.<br /><br />Automation is much more reliable than a sleepy shark!<br /><br />So,at the high level the 15 BTC loss is balanced by 30 BTC gain from DRK, but XCP is a bit weaker and we are probable less than 10BTC different from yesterday. At current scale,this is less than half percent so I wont change the sharkfund0 quotes, especially since the next leg in DRK's journey is a pullback to around .0225. I believe it is in the process of forming a &quot;flag pattern&quot;, most flags are rectangular but for some reason in technical analysis flags are those small triangle ones. What is happening is that fewer and fewer people are left that will either buy or sell, so the price movements shrink in magnitude as it oscillates around a middle ground.<br /><br />If you look at current DRK chart, you will see it is oscillating around the .023 to .024 level. What happens is that it is kind of like a game of chicken between buyers and sellers. With something as volatile as DRK the LEAST likely thing is for it to continue horizontally at the same price. Imagine the odds of that! DRK between .023 and .024 for a month. Sure, and someone will forge 1440 blocks in a row too when that happens.<br /><br />OK, so, up or down?<br /><br />The thing is that only the big whales who decide this actually know and maybe they dont even know. It might be like me with XC last night. Someone with a big DRK holding gets a bad feeling and sells and breaks out of the tight range. Then it snowballs. Or the opposite could just as easily happen.<br /><br />Flip a coin. Cant predict. So you just have to watch and wait to see what happens. That is much easier <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />Of course you make less money than using psychic powers, but I try to save my psychic powers for other things<br /><br />James

					Crazy market. BTC is strongly up to $568, which is weakening NXT a bit in terms of BTC, but NXT is up fractionally against USD<br /><br />DRK bounced right off of .02, just like somebody predicted, and is gradually building back up to .025. We will see if it pushes through or reflects back. I predict it will go sideways for a while, mostly due to the up and coming anon coins and the original ANC all being strong.<br /><br />DRK +2%, quite impressive considering its recent gains<br />XCP +6%, these are just coinmarketcap percentage vs USD<br />MRO +30% and now it is #16<br />XC +383%! and already at #18<br />ANC +18%<br /><br />OK, so I got lucky again. Time to adjust asset value for sharkfund0 as it has to have gone up a bit with all five up. I did pick up a sharkbite from a couple more coins, a bit risky, but using locked in gains from MRO and XC, so not risking capital, just some profits. When you are on a roll, keep rolling <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br />portfolio changed a lot, so I will just use summary info:<br />10000 DRK @ .0225 = 225 BTC + 12000 XCP @ .0058 = 69.6 BTC<br />polo 148 BTC + bter 137 BTC + cryptsy 102 BTC + direct deposit 10 btc = 691.6 BTC @ .000066<br />10478787 NXT equivalent + 9668985 + open orders 502367 = 20650139 / 1921.5745 active sharkfund0<br /><br />New sharkfund0 asset value is 10746.4685<br /><br />Yikes! It is going up too fast. There is no way I can sustain this level of performance. Its been a lot of luck the recent days. Please do not expect this to keep up. Everyone says its impossible to do better than random and it has to be pure luck that I have gained over 1.4 million NXT in a week of active trading, right?<br /><br />Anyway, new ask is 10746.4685 and bid is 10559.8513
