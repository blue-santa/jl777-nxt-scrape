Also &quot;Hero members&quot; are failing with their assets, just because they are not doing what they have announced in their IPO post. Just for example &quot;pf&quot; spent diividends of hrnxtpool in ltcgear shares instead of buying hardware miner).<br /><br />So, also the request directed to newbies to disclose the system of business to &quot;trusted, long time members&quot; is IMHO just a joke. Even every company &quot;in real life&quot; wouldn't let you know. Everyone is afraid of copycats.<br /><br />I think everyone in NXT is responsible for himself/herself. Let them learn their lessons. If someone trusts an asset, let them invest. I really don't like that &quot;ponzi ponzi scam scam scam&quot; postings. Ask questions, if they are answered satis, buy the asset - otherwise don't do. That's quite simple and not a question of &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;newbie&quot;.<br />&nbsp; <br />best...<br />dhj.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just because someone has a reputation, doesn't mean the asset is good, but it's at least a start. We know there are people who are continually starting new accounts and preying off new members by launching exciting looking assets, so a new account has become a warning sign. This is something that people new to the forum might not be aware of. (This isn't about elitism.) It is pretty bad (in my opinion) to let people fall into scam without saying anything when it's often 99%+ clear what is going on.<br /><br />We want Nxt to be a good coin for others, and the asset exchange is a great feature of Nxt. Part of building this coin and this community is helping new people become part of this technology, whether that is telling them how to forge, how important a secure password is, why they have to be careful to check an asset ID, and that particular assets are obvious scams.<br /><br />Many people might come to this forum with main experience of assets being wall street assets. They understand that the value of assets can fall as well as rise, but they mightn't understand the risk that the asset is a total sham.<br /><br />Anyone is free to start their own asset, no one is trying to stop that, Nxt as a platform is available to all. But nxtforum is a private forum and I think established members have an obligation to warn newer members.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I was thinking the same thing and came up with the idea of a &quot;signature warning&quot; that the senior members can use. So when a new scam asset appears, we update the list in our sigs about &quot;Likely scam assets: vultmining, autodiv, camels milk, solar farm...&quot;<br /><br />I was hoping all the trades of the scam assets were scammer's own churn, but apparently the easy money promises gets some real funds into these scams.<br /><br />I am too busy to be following closely all these scams as they come up, but if there was a thread where I can easily get a signature to use, I would. hint,hint.<br /><br />James

Even if non-newbie assets fail 50% of the time, that is 50x better using these hypothetical numbers.<br /><br />So, dont use reasonable sounding words to try to establish that newbie issuers are just as good as established ones. I think you are backing the mythical Thai solar farm?<br /><br />I am not saying all newbie assets are scams, I am just saying that assuming that they are until they are proven not to be is a much better path to avoiding being scammed. The whole &quot;I am afraid of competition so I cant disclose any details&quot; and &quot;I use a newbie account to protect my privacy&quot; and &quot;I cant disclose how we make money&quot; these are alarm bells. If anybody really thinks that somebody else will fly to Thailand to buyout a solar farm based on posting the details, well this is not credible at all. You can always confide in NXTinspect. If you cant trust them to not steal your idea, I cant trust you to buy your asset.<br /><br />James

					Libertynow is cool. He has lived up to his commitments, even when it hurts his bank acct. If he says he will do something, he does. I am glad that we now have the second reliable market making asset available. With so many ponzi assets most claiming to be automated trading, but some are solar farms and camels milk??<br /><br />The person behind the asset is really the only thing that matters. Notice how LibertyNow is using his real handle? This is a clear message that he will stand behind what he says.<br /><br />I am at the point now where I dont even think of buying an asset from a newbie account, especially if they say their real world identity is public. Those are the ones that scam the biggest!<br /><br />So, feel safe to buy this asset without worrying about it being a scam. Now, how much profits it will make, this is something that only time will tell. However, I have a feeling that similar to coinomat's MMNXT asset, this one will become a mainstay of the NXT assets.<br /><br />James

A much bigger danger is human error or somebody in your inner circle somehow getting access. Social engineering things. Some cute girl rings your doorbell (happens to me all the time!) asking for some sugar...<br /><br />So, to protect against these sorts of things, if you are really paranoid, you can make ~10 accts. 9 of these will be &quot;cold&quot; and accessed just once per month. They will all have around 10% of your holdings, so no single acct represents catastrophic loss. Then have a smallish acct for day to day usage. protect the passwords with multiple encrypted offline copies, or paper printout in a bank vault if you have access to such. (might not be a bad idea for legacy handover to inheritors to have paper instructions in a known place to them).<br /><br />OK, now to operate at the highest levels of safety you need a dedicated computer (doesnt have to be powerful, just dedicated for this and offline). A fresh OS install, never connected to the internet. copy the entire nxt folder from a computer that has seen your accts (this way they know about the public keys). Now you can do offline transactions for all the &quot;cold&quot; accounts.<br /><br />it is a bit of a hassle, but you generate the signed transaction bytes, copy to USB. and then load the USB from your day to day computer and submit them to the network.<br /><br />The above is NOT necessary, but if you follow something like the above it protects against social engineering attacks, keyloggers, but still no defense against those cute girls ringing your bell.<br /><br />James

So far the only sale has come at 15 NXT. I notice a couple people are racing to the bottom with lower prices. Smart holders would get that daily dividend and go for a much larger payoff total and really maximize their value. That is how the long-term gain is paid. Most assets will peak after a week or two and then continuously lose money. A constant dividend payer with a very small float MUST go in the opposite direction based on the laws of finance.<br /><br />Today I realized how much AutoDiv has appreciated. 1000*.00084180=.84 BTC.<br /><br />1000 AutoDiv are now worth .84 BTC. Incredible value but I think they will probably go much, much higher if people are patient. Pretty amazing that people got 5000 of those for free out of a total of 14545 ever issued and their 'free' assets are worth around 4 BTC at the current price. All this in two weeks time.<br /><br />I am not trying to too my own horn but that is what crypto should be all about. Maximum value for investors. AutoDiv3 is starting to sell pretty well and the first dividend payment is scheduled for tomorrow. I think the future is very bright for this offering too. Thanks to you for being a part of the journey.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>dont you have aged sockpuppets? the ones that you make and use right away are pretty easy to spot.<br />To my knowledge you have not disclosed any details about how you are earning &quot;profits&quot;, so based on your past history (none) we need to assume you are using funds from asset sales to pay the dividends. This is the classic definition of ponzi.<br /><br />So, prove to a trusted member you are not running ponzis, until then we will assume it is a ponzi.<br /><br />James

Right now most people are probably minting this just to make some fast money rather than looking for a new currency to build up. Which in terms of money is barely anything since there is very little liquidity in the exchange. In the early days it was something new and interesting to at least test out but since then its slowed down.<br /><br />MS currencies are secured by NXT so there is no use for securing by mining(in this case minting) like other PoW currencies. I feel that the only thing MS currencies have going for it atm is the fact when minting it gives NXT forging some value because of all the tx fees made.<br /><br />Until demand and value can be made the sell pressure will continue since there is barely any buying pressure. Marketplaces, games, etc. have to be made to get any use out of any of these currencies where they can be exchanged with as little reliance on NXT being used. <br /><br />A reason for minting has to develop so these currencies can gain real value to the average crypto user if not then MS currencies have very little chance of succeeding on its current path. In my opinion <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I've just started to test out counterparty(was bored at school :p) and it feels just the same basically as MS Currrncies(at least so far) where it relies on BTC for fees and also piggybacks on the BTC blockchain to confirm transactions and such. Maybe I'm wrong <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /> Maybe a new MS dev can create a new MS currency that one sends NXT to the genesis in return for MS currency... Lol<br /><br /><strong>Tldr;;...</strong>feel that MS Currencies have no use for now even though devs put great work. Need new ideas to get use of Currencies if not doesn't look bright for future. MS Currencies feel like XCP in my view.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How are MS coins any different than the zillion gen1 clones?
