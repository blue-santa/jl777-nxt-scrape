Its value is the future revenues it will generate. The 10% loss of sharkfund on 10% of InstantDEX value is a 1% magnitude. <br /><br />Do you understand what I am saying about this? Even if InstantDEX is forced to liquidate its sharkfund at a loss, it is a shortfall of ~200000 NXT, which is bad of course, but in the overall picture a &lt;1% issue. I am assuring you that InstantDEX wont live or die based on this 200000 NXT.<br /><br />Are you really so upset about 1%?<br /><br />In any case, even if the unthinkable happens and InstantDEX absolutely needs every last NXT and the lost 200000 NXT from untimely forced liquidation of sharkfund jeopardizes InstantDEX, what do you think I would do at that point?<br /><br />a) say business has risks, tough cookies<br />b) admit I made a mistake by doing the sharkfund thing and personally making up the 200000 NXT<br /><br />James<br /><br />

Though such a function doesn&#039;t actually exist, it&#039;s acceptable to pretend since modern hash functions are pretty good.<br /><br /><a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/48022/what-kinds-of-encryption-are-not-breakable-via-quantum-computers" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/48022/what-kinds-of-encryption-are-not-breakable-via-quantum-computers</a><br /><br />This here says that a hashing algorithm like Sha would be broken to n/3 with quantum computing, which isn&#039;t so bad as they&#039;re already broken to n/2 with normal computing. You only need 128 bits of security, so using the first 128*3 bits (48 bytes) will future-proof you against quantum attacks. Unfortunately, signatures do not enjoy the same security. Luckily Sia is script based, which means that signatures can be adjusted on-the-fly by changing the scripts.<br /><br />The thing I would be worried about is someone taking w, and then some set of hashes that takes less space to store than w.x.y.z and being able to prove for x,y,z using w and that set of hashes. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible, as proving for each of w.x.y.z requires a completely different permutation of hashing. I&#039;m fairly confident with the approach, I just don&#039;t have a proof.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you make the assumption that you have a perfect hash function, then you should be able to prove this. At least it makes sense to me that the only way to know what to provide is if you have the real data.<br /><br />since w, x, y and z are all independent, if you can prove it for one specific ordering, I think it would apply to all orderings, as permuting the order of w,x,y,z wont change the problem, or rather proving you have w, x, y, or z are all isomorphic to each other, right?<br /><br />If the node is returning w, then he must have stored w and the network can verify w hashes to a. So (given the assumptions) we can prove the node has w (as long as it hashes to a). I do not understand the concern about storing the other hashes. The node proved it has w by providing the 4kb, or are you saying it only provided a?<br /><br />

So we have to talk in nxt. Fact is if e.g. instantdex would have kept nxt and not have bought sharkfund0 value would be higher in nxt and btc now, or do am i missing something?

However, I do not foresee InstantDEX needing any more NXT than it currently has that will force it to sell at a loss, so I do not see how this has impacted InstantDEX<br /><br />Anyway, in crypto prices are volatile, +/- 10% happens daily, the fact that sharkfund0 has been as stable it has is due to its hybrid construction. I know everybody wants only to have positive gains all the time, but that is not how crypto works, or at least I am not able to achieve that. Now if NXT has a correction to .00008 then will you praise me for my acumen? If that happens, the non-NXT portion of sharkfund will more than make up for the current 12% loss. There are no guarantees and from InstantDEX (and other operating companies standpoint) I prefer to have a less volatile store of value than raw NXT as any future cash needs will most likely be denominated in fiat or BTC<br /><br />As far as InstantDEX goes, it has all the NXT needed to establish revenues and dividends. The current salary I am taking for managing InstantDEX is 0 NXT per month. In fact I am not currently taking any salary from any of the assets and continue to put in more personal funds and assets.<br /><br />I only know of two TEAM members that have quit. Some never really got going but a lot are doing many good works as you know. I am here to support TEAM members and not the traditional task master type of manager. This means that some people who are not self starters might not have enough structure.<br /><br />NXTsharks does purchase any crypto when I feel there is a short term price imbalance. I have purchased shortNXT, and other NXT AE assets with sharkfund0 and the net gains are in excess of 100000 NXT. Since liquidity is low, the trades are usually &lt;0.1% of sharkfund so not really that signficant, but occasionally I get a nice gain.<br /><br />NXTventure owns NXTsharks as that is one of the future offerings in the pipeline. I do not understand what the day to day detail of NXTsharks trading has to do with NXTventure.<br />

Wesleyh is involved in InstantDEX GUI, but I am not expecting any of these to be integrated into the official GUI. People will have to specifically optin and request NXTservices.<br /><br />Now I did propose a universal gateway protocol that allows a gateway agnostic way of integrating &quot;get deposit address&quot; and &quot;withdraw bitcoin&quot; into the official GUI. The user would have to put in the NXT acct of their gateway for this function to even work, so while the ability to interface to gateways that conform to the interface is in the GUI, I think this will be acceptable to you?

It wont be very CPU intensive and a major node might need ddos protection, but I think each server node would be able to handle 64 to 128 subscribers.<br /><br />At 10 NXT per subscriber, that isnt that expensive for people that will want to be using the services and it should be enough to pay for a decent server. One of the key features is InstantDEX UDP proxy. If you are doing direct UDP to someone you dont trust, you just divulged your IP address and I know a lot of people will want the speed of InstantDEX without compromising their privacy. There would be a slight performance hit going through a proxy, but privacy trumps performance when dealing with strangers on the internet.<br /><br />I want to solve the problem of needing to continue server subsidies and switch to a for-profit (or at least not-losing-money) basis. Basically anybody running ubuntu would be able to start an instance and then obtain subscribers who trust them. For a low end VM instance, I think ~10 subscribers to breakeven, not counting the nodecoins<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Even without paying subscribers, a ServerNode will earn significantly more nodecoins than a ClientNode.

It is down 100 BTC from peak and XCP is also down significantly. To counter this, monero is looking pretty good in spite of today's correction. Things can change fast but the big valuation changes are actually reasonably rare, so the current status is that sharkfund is up significantly in BTC and fiat, down around 10% in NXT terms, but it has established 0.5% to 1% stakes in various coins and once DRK gets masternodes working I expect the asset value to get back to parity in NXT terms<br /><br />On the TEAM members, do you expect me to post what everyone is doing? I hope not, I expect each person to make their own reports!<br /><br />James

It looks like it should work, but I'm nervous that I've missed something simple, an easy way to cheat the system.<br /><br />How the new file proofs work:<br /><br />File segments are split into 4kb pieces, exactly N 4kb pieces.<br />A merkle tree is made of these 4kb pieces, only the final hash is kept. As an example, I'll use a 4 piece segment, 16kb total.<br /><br />The bottom level is 4 4kb pieces, w.x.y.z<br />The next level up is their hashes, a.b.c.d<br />The next level up is each pair together, A=h(a+b), B=h(c+d), for the level A.B<br />The top level, O, is the hash of A and B, O=h(A+B)<br /><br />The network randomly selects a piece for you to prove that you have, knowing only O. The network wants w<br />So, to prove that you have w, you provide w,b, and B. The network then hashes w to get a, then hashes a+b to get A, then hashes A and B to get O.<br /><br />This same sequence can be performed with any other of w.x.y.z, except that the order in which the hashing is done changes depends on which piece you are proving for.<br /><br />The problem is that I've been having trouble proving that it's secure. I thought that the proof already existed somewhere, Merkle Trees are pretty well established. The tricky part is that the network only knows about O, and the person attempting the proof is allowed to provide every other component. This should be a normal feature of a Merkle Tree but again I'm having trouble finding/devising a proof of security. I was hoping that someone here could help me out with a link or something.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I dont think you can actually prove it is secure, because there is always the chance to find something else that hashes to the same value. granted it is very remote and would be cost prohibitive to do all the calculations to spoof this.<br /><br />Since it is theoretically possible, even though it is impractical, any &quot;proof&quot; that this is secure would most likely be wrong. I think what you would be able to find is the probability that it is correct, which should be quite high.<br /><br />Some people say Quantum Computer could crack SHA256, so in that case it wont be secure, but then again neither will bitcoin and a lot of other crypto<br /><br />Using just common sense, it seems that for anybody to be able to &quot;fill in the blank&quot; with the proper values, they are almost certain to have the correct data, especially since the gain from spoofing is relatively small. At least I think it is small <br /><br />Please dont take my thoughts as anything definitive, this is an area that I am not too strong in.<br /><br />James

					Now that MGW is in beta, I am finally having time to finalize the InstantDEX. While working on this (combined with some recently increased personal privacy requirements) I realized that I can implement NXTprivacy to some degree at the same time.<br /><br />I have also identified a way for MGW to offer a service for InstantDEX and earn a per transaction fee. Still working out the details, but having MGW allows for some new monetization possibilities that I had not fully understood before.<br /><br />I am also designing a peer to peer betting system and this sort of thing needs privacy, since all these intertwine to some degree, I will need to solve most of the interaction issues first before finalizing InstantDEX.<br /><br />Currrently, I expect to be able to implement personal and business level privacy, but it will require some server providers to run at least part of the NXTservices. I am planning on a valuable service that people will pay ~10 NXT per month that in turn will subsidize the servers that are helping secure the NXT network.<br /><br />Not to forget NXTcoinsco, nodecoin will be returning soon and will have real value from its ability to obtain extra NXTservices otherwise not available. Also, SVMcoin details will be coming this summer and it will enable 'bot makers to develop and test trading bots at a low cost and then actually earn fees when other traders subscribe to their bot's signals. SVMcoin will be the currency used in this space and owners of SVMcoin will share in the trading bot fees.<br /><br />NXTcoinsco will allow automated trading via InstantDEX, which when combined with NXTforex will allow for the largest automated trading market to be within NXT, eg. fiat currency trading.<br /><br />So, I am finally seeing how all the different parts I have been working on will enhance each other dramatically. I knew they would, just didnt see all the details until now that MGW is a solid reference point.<br /><br />NXTventure will be issuing two internal assets soon, one for privacy and one for betting. My goal is to fully decentralize everything except MGW, which is as decentralized as possible for being a gateway. There is no reason we cant get more and more MGW trio of servers to spread the load if just having one trio is too centralized, but that seems to be an issue for later this year.<br /><br />DomP and pandaisftw are in the process of organizing and expanding NXTsharks so we can expect some news on that front in a bit.<br /><br />Boost has started a pilot program and looks promising for the long term.<br /><br />So this is quite an ambitious summer plan I have made for myself, but other than a few parts of InstantDEX, the hardest part of all this is MGW, which is almost done. I cant promise any specific release date, but I have alpha to beta level code for the vast majority of this roadmap and just one tricky part deep within InstantDEX to solve.

A question that can be addressed more seriously towards <em>any centralized exchange</em>, and that the multigateway service operators are in a position to address more firmly than any centralized exchange thanks to the server architecture.<br /><br />Of course fanaticalfishing is free to leave if he wants.

Remember MGW balances are publicly verified in near realtime. <br /><br />James

It works via chrome but my python script is having trouble with it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>it is in a different code path than most, but should still be the same<br />if it works with chrome, not sure why it wont work with python<br />i know longzai and poofknuckle got it to work for them

The blockchain can't be shut down. NxtServices, on the other hand, will exist on only a few servers. So, in a way, it has a physical location. I see this as more of an issue if NxtTorrent takes off. If governments aren't happy with what's being sold on it, they may be able to order the NxtServices servers shut down.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>MGW has three servers, but actually it is possible to have more than one set of triplets, each with a subset of all deposits.<br />NXTsync currently has a single directory server, but I am in the process of decentralizing it<br />almost all the other NXTservices are fully decentralized<br />
