When enough users use that, its impossible to transmit these transactions? Correct me if iam wrong..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Censorhip is legally defined as something like &quot;restriction to the public&quot;. My solution does not restrict because others can still provide the access to the public. I simply want to <strong>choose not to participate in storing or transmitting certain types of ads</strong>.<br /><br /><a href="http://thelawdictionary.org/censorship/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://thelawdictionary.org/censorship/</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I totally agree.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>ok, so the network forks whenever there is some controversial tx. This is an attack vector.<br /><br />In a blockchain all nodes need to deterministically arrive at the exact same bits. Otherwise a fork happens<br /><br />Now how to actually achieve this level of consensus when each node is making different settings?<br /><br />I think the model of filtering ads is being used when it is a peer to peer decentralized network, which works differently. Why not to just block locally via GUI, you wont see the things you dont want to see. <br /><br />If it is a problem that your computer is involved with controversial bits, then please immediately uninstall all file sharing software, all crypto (already illegal in several countries), and might as well stop using the internet as there is all sorts of horrible content on it.<br /><br />So you need to either accept that in a decentralized system without centralized control, nobody has control over the bits that are flowing. However you can control what you see. So, use a lite client if you dont want any chance of dirty bits to touch your computer. But what about the oxygen that was used by criminals? Even being Amish wont solve that problem<br /><br />James

The only benefit is peace of mind: the feeling that you've kept your hands clean. <br /><br />If merely running a &quot;dirty&quot; decentralized node becomes actionable in law, then we'll have a lot of warning. The first target for any crackdown will be the TOR network, as it's the home of the Darknet. <br /><br />(Unless, that is, the authorities have a hate-on for crypto specifically...in which case, we have a much bigger problem than &quot;dirty forging.&quot;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>it seems life sentences are being handed out, when the max sentence for any of the &quot;crimes&quot; was 20 years...<br /><br />I think the war on the crypto will escalate for a while, especially in some parts of the world. Since bad people will do bad things and bad people use crypto, internet, cars, electricity, trains, planes, oxygen, etc. to outlaw the things that criminals use makes criminals out of everyone. Just think, you are breathing the same air molecules that some criminal breathed! But I think that is the entire point. Once everybody can be threatened with jail sentences, it becomes much easier to do the confiscations that will be happening soon.<br /><br />So it is the choice of accepting 80% tax rates (income, sales, VAT, insurance, inflation, etc), to be followed by inheritance tax, ie defacto slavery to the state or to choose to live free. Just make sure to avoid countries where the govts have the power for 24/7 surveillance of everything and SWAT teams that keep the children safe<br /><br />James

Running a node doesn&#039;t necessarily mean you&#039;re forging. Running a node is not a business, forging is.<br /><br />Forgers should have a choice who&#039;s transactions to block if they&#039;d like to. If they don&#039;t have this choice, it&#039;s like these regulations imposed upon them from the top as if they aren&#039;t masters of their own business. In real world you have situations like this <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1044772.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1044772.0</a> why can&#039;t the baker refuse to do business with this particular customer? Isn&#039;t he owner of this business? Turns out he is not. Do we want the same?<br /><br />Forgers purchase and fully own their stakes and should have freedom to decide to grant or to deny service. If a user&#039;s transaction is denied by a particular forger, by design the user&#039;s transaction automatically goes to another forger. Isn&#039;t this advocating more freedom than regulating forgers from the top and forcing them all into one herd? All I am asking for is a tool, kind of like when the devs created a special brand of the software after the bter hack and let the market forces decide. What&#039;s different in what I am proposing? It doesn&#039;t have to be in the official release, just a couple of patched source code files that forgers can compile to deny service to accounts they choose. It doesn&#039;t involve forks, forgers would have to accept blocks forged by others with transactions from accounts they don&#039;t &#039;like&#039;, seriously, it&#039;s only a small patch, which most forgers wouldn&#039;t use anyway, but that would keep forgers with different moral convictions happy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>sure you can make something that lets you click an &quot;x&quot; when it is an unconfirmed tx to make sure you wont forge it<br />seems like a lot of work...<br /><br />and as soon as somebody does include it in a block, then your node has to process it, so what has been achieved? I think just some peace of mind. Since that is all that is achieved, why not to just make a client side filter in the GUI? out of sight out of mind<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I dont know of anybody that is making any business from forging, the 0.5% return is not the best way for using funds to maximize ROI. It is more a spam prevention/network security issue, so to be making special code for peace of mind for spam prevention. this is what is being discussed here

This unofficial patch to the core is unlikely to be an efficient filtering technique but will give peace of mind to the concerned. I believe every business owner should have a right to refuse to do business with any customer she doesn't like to deal with, that is freedom of choice. Forgers are in the business of processing transactions. Few of them can code this patch on their own but many may want to outsource it this job to a skilled dev.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>running a node is like being a router in the Internet. Now there are routers that are indeed filtering the traffic, and what do we feel about such places?<br /><br />I think the solution is to just run a lite node if you just cannot stand the possibility of having controversial bits flowing through your node.<br /><br />Remember, decentralization is a new paradigm. Let us use an old one to get some perspective. <br /><br />TV<br /><br />At first TV is totally centralized and people didnt have to bother to worry what type of content as it was pretty much govt controlled broadcasts. The good old days, right?<br /><br />Then the cable TV comes and makes it so ordinary wires are possible to use instead of highly regulated and expensive broadcast frequencies. Now there is 500 channels of questionable content and people start to worry about what they are able to watch. But by having filters people can avoid seeing the controversial content.<br /><br />Then we get the Internet with video and now there are a much larger places for content. To keep up with a content filter requires entire companies working night and day with large staffs. It is confusing to me about all this work just to prevent yourself from accidentally seeing disgusting content, but if you have money to burn, why not? I find it simpler to just not go to goatse<br /><br />Let us further decentralize and now each node is part of a global wifi mesh network. All of a sudden it becomes possible for every sort of thing to flow through your node and if you dont route it, then your node is getting blacklisted as it isnt following the protocol.<br /><br />But remember these are just bits. 1's and 0's and they themselves are not the real thing (usually) but just represent something else. So all this talk of censorship of the 1's and 0's is basically identical to wanting to censor books and information. Of course Australia and Russia are banning the teaching of crypto, so indeed with centralized govt powers it is possible to make the censorship. Is this a good thing or bad?<br /><br />If you believe in the basic goodness of people, then you should trust them to make the right choice, but give them the choice! If you believe that govt is required to choose for the people since they are not smart enough, then by all means a centralized active content filter method is the way to go. Why not to just let the govt dictate 100% what is allowed to be done and what isnt? In fact, might as well just send you privkeys to the govt as they will know how to use your money much better than you will.<br /><br />Some govts are making the crypto illegal. So if to follow the govt rules, you must abandon the crypto.<br /><br />Now technically, if your node is not accepting valid tx, then you will go on a fork, so the choice is to be a good law abiding citizen that follows all the laws (even the ones that contradict each other) and forfeit all your assets to the govt, or to just make a client side filter so you dont see what offends you or run a lite client.<br /><br />James

It can come from the fundraising and VC in the very beginning, But eventually the business have to generate the non-stop revenue stream by itself because VC will stop at some point if the business can't generate its own revenue stream.

Profit can be found as long as you have the revenue and is the ultimate long term goal.<br /><br />The operation usually is ruthless and cold blooded. It is pure numbers and math.

As far as modeling, it is a matter for making sure that the sum of unspents for all the addresses are matching. If it does, then not sure what sort of modeling is needed? Keep in mind that the Lchain is built on top of the blockchain, so it does not need to replicate all the blockchain mechanisms<br /><br />I claim that in 25 years, most all transactions this year are not so important to require every node to keep a copy of it. But quarterly or even monthly ledgers could be kept on all nodes for quite a while. So if a few years goes by and all nodes are agreeing to the ledgers for the past years, then after some years it is not such a big disaster to lose records of each and every tx.<br /><br />There are some significant privacy implications here too

Now maybe somebody can point out how it is different from the blockchain if the ledger in the Lchain is exactly matching the unspent account balances by reprocessing the blockchain (at every block)<br /><br />In the real world there are things like annual audits, quarterly and the transactions are relative to the most recent audited ledger. Imagine reprocessing all the transactions for the last 25 years, after exponential growth in transactions? It is a matter of time before it is not practical.<br /><br />the blockchain at the tx level does not scale to real world volumes. Also I prefer not to use superstition or historical solutions as a requirement. If that is the case, there can be no improvements as it would be different from the past.

The fact that just one reference site or one node stays honest is enough to identify a problem means the odds are vanishingly small to be attacked even with 99% attacker saturation. Of course you wont be able to do anything with 99% attacker saturation. I will ignore any such total saturation scenarios<br /><br />James

That is creating a special new &quot;block 0&quot; that may become valid after X new blocks are put on top of it, that contains just all the balances of all the accounts with a positive balance. once this special block is created, and has a full consensus, new miners can download the blockchain starting only from this new special genesis block. For historical records, some can keep the full blockchain, but it is just an option.<br /><br />Would this crazy idea work?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How would the new miners know the new genesis block was supported by the consensus, without access to the prior block-chain? It sounds vulnerable to a Sybil attack.<br /><br />That said, it sounds a bit like one of the ideas in Economic Clusters, where-by if there's a fork, and you are doing business with, say, Amazon, you tell your node to accept the same branch of the fork that Amazon are on so you can have transactions with them. Telling the software whom you trust, basically. It's not ideal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think you are extrapolating from an assumption and then deducing things from that. It's not ideal.<br /><br />Some more information to allow further analysis:<br /><br />The Lchain is isomorphic to the blockchain<br /><br />L0 is the empty ledger (genesis)<br />L10000 is the ledger at block 10000<br /><br />L0 + blocks 0 to 9999 -&gt; L10000<br /><br />Part of the ledger is the ledgerhash which is comprised of 11 sub-hashes (one for each dataset)<br />Extrapolating this, we get L10000 -&gt; L20000 -&gt; .... L400000<br /><br />With the property that you can start from any ledger and replay the blocks between that ledger and the next one<br />and end up with the same hashes (still some bugs I have here, only half the hashes match in the resume case)<br /><br />Now each node is keeping their Lchain hashes and a new node can query N peers to verify that there is consensus on this. it can also reprocess from genesis if it wants<br /><br />Since there will be 100% consensus on older blocks there is no room for any mismatches on the ledger hashes, until we get close to realtime. But, if you notice, the time consuming part of the process (recalculating from genesis) has no controversy and you can quickly find the only valid sequence of Lchain, get a version from a week ago, verify its hash.<br /><br />and then just reprocess from there to realtime. Now this approach assumes there is still a blockchain for recent blocks. The key is to offset the latest ledger to far enough in the past so that a false chain cannot overcome the valid chain weight. something like every day, generate a ledger for a week ago. Then the only blocks ever needed are the past week's blocks. These timings can easily be tuned. Also, it is assumed that there will be some archival nodes that are storing all the historical blocks, but after all the nodes are validating the Lchain and if 100% of the nodes are showing the same ledgerhashes, then this is not needing any decisions by new miners on which fork to use as there wont be any forks for the past.<br /><br />Hybrid solution. Use ledgers for the past where there is no forks, use blockchain for recent blocks where things are still in flux. By combining these two methods, I expect the Lchain to grow linearly in size as opposed to exponentially.<br /><br />Please try to come up with attack vectors<br /><br />James

For example, fair-provable slot machine, roulette, etc....<br /><br />I think the hash conversion could be map onto more complicated problem than multifacet dice throw. All you need for these applications is a random number generator.
