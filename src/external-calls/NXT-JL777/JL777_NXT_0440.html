I am unable to use NRS at the moment because I would also be storing data that is I think is bad. I want to use more than a light client. I want to forge and I am being denied that right by the developers and the forgers that support the propagation of the Gen 2 blockchain. <span class="bbc_u">You prove this deduction by telling people not to forge</span> which is wrong.<br /><br />You are a talented developer and have made huge contributions to SuperNet and Nxt. But, I think you are not able to see the opportunity here for Gen 3 blockchain tech. You are letting your own ethics about hatred for fiat and governments cloud your overall view of developing a system that supports <span class="bbc_u">personal ethics</span>. By doing this you are becoming tyrannical by implying your ethics are the valid ones. Sadly, it's clear you don't understand what personal ethics are since you equate them to government regulation. However, you have a chance to improve your wisdom here with our help.<br /><br />In a Gen 3 system, its obvious that the blockchain is not going to be a complete replication. It will be a base chain with optional chain extensions that can be subscribed to. And the base chain will support searches to find the appropriate base chain extensions.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>what you describe is not a blockchain, almost by its definition<br /><br />anyway, the SuperNET agent system is allowing the type of thing you are writing about as people can choose which agents to subscribe to. <br /><br />plz let us avoid making any assumptions about each other's ethics or their understanding thereof. <br /><br />my comments have been to clarify what is likely to be possible or not technically without making a major project out of it. my advice to not forge is a stopgap

This does <strong>not</strong> require a fork.<br /><br />Please make a difference between propagating/storing blocks/transactions by nodes in the network AND forging. It makes sense to discuss a patch related to <strong>forging</strong>. Unofficial too, not added to the core software. Not for everyone, but for forgers who <strong>choose</strong> to use it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>sure, but it wont solve the objection as your computer will still come in contact with evil bits. these bits once in the evil pattern will take on a life of its own and infect all around with an evil spirit and make everyone into zombies<br /><br />All of this would be avoided if the GUI did not display the marketplace without censorship. After all who would even notice?<br /><br />Why not to work on GUI filter, this is solving 99.99% of the issue<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sarcasm is good, but only to a certain extent. I posted a link upthread on the Christian baker refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding and getting shut down. Forcing all forgers to process transactions for all is the same top-down regulation. Forgers are in business of processing transactions, it doesn't matter it's only 0.5% a year, they still charge customers for that service, and they must be free to choose which customers to serve. It's their stake, their investment, they should be able to control it. And did I mention the patch should not be in the official client? Oh, I think I did, stupid amnesia.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>nobody is forcing anybody to forge. I think this is the disconnect.<br /><br />forgers are opting to collect the tx fees of the block they generate. so if that is your only objection, the solution is to stop forging until a version is made that allows you to somehow specify which tx you will forge. will you just ban all marketplace tx?<br /><br />now technically it is not against the protocol to not include a tx even if the block is not full, but this is not exactly the expected role of the node that generates a block. But you can do this right now. just turn off forging whenever your node is about to collect some fees, but it includes some tx you dont like.<br /><br />Let us not debate about the morality of one person determining what another person should be allowed to do. Nobody forces anybody to generate a block, so this is no top-down regulation. But if some people had their way the majority of tx will never be allowed.<br /><br />James<br /><br />

This does <strong>not</strong> require a fork.<br /><br />Please make a difference between propagating/storing blocks/transactions by nodes in the network AND forging. It makes sense to discuss a patch related to <strong>forging</strong>. Unofficial too, not added to the core software. Not for everyone, but for forgers who <strong>choose</strong> to use it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>sure, but it wont solve the objection as your computer will still come in contact with evil bits. these bits once in the evil pattern will take on a life of its own and infect all around with an evil spirit and make everyone into zombies<br /><br />All of this would be avoided if the GUI did not display the marketplace without censorship. After all who would even notice?<br /><br />Why not to work on GUI filter, this is solving 99.99% of the issue

There are literally 100's of legitimate things that are used by criminals, and we can't ban them all, nor should we. Criminals love fast Audis, for example.<br /><br />Nxt is an open system, and can be completely monitored with little effort by law enforcement if they decide to do so. <br />Individual Nxt users can themselves choose to report suspicious/criminal activity if they see it. <br />I think that this will be enough to keep NXT relatively 'clean', and is (imho) very much preferable to trying to achieve a technical solution to arrive at <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>consensus</strong></span></span> on a blockchain where every node <span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>is verifying a slightly different set of transactions</strong></span></span>.......<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Hopefully you see the contradiction.<br /><br />GUI filter<br />lite node<br />Amish commune<br />or let the bits flow<br />

Bitcoin is Gen 1 blockchain tech and it doesn't climb very far up the ethics tree.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Indeed.<br /><br />I am worried about calling something that is an ethical CHOICE &quot;censorship&quot; or narrowing the discourse to &quot;legalities&quot;.<br /><br />I, as a user, may not want to be forced to propagate something, purely because I do not want to be involved, regardless of whether it's legal or illegal.<br /><br />THAT is what this is about, and nothing else, in my opinion. <br /><br />Building on this, this leads to a few questions:<br /><br />1. Do we want a system that forces people to propagate things that they don't want to<br />1.1 Is it possible, without forking, to create something that would allow people to choose which tx to propagate<br />1.2 Is the cure actually a cure?<br />1.3 Is the cure not create problems that are insurmountable<br />2. Does the solution nééd to be Native or can this be done with a plugin?<br />2.1 Which of these fits best in our system?<br /><br />I am sure there are more questions, but these are neutral, non partisan and practical.<br /><br />I see a tendency for these discussions to become completely muddled by cramming in things that are actually more to do with opinion than with looking to see if it's possible, viable, and practical. That's a pity, because sooner or later the emotions overtake sensible discussion and no real discussion has been had, only division. I think we can be better than that.<br /><br />Oh, and I cannot resist pointing out personally that I have worked with addicts and no, they are not pitiable wrecks of humanity. Neither are they weak willed idiots. Most of them are good people who inadvertantly found themselves in a situation where all control was lost. It's easier to reach that situation than you can imagine. I hope none of you ever will, but if you do, be glad not everyone stigmatises these people and there is help, which you deserve.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am finding it hard to see how there can be a single blockchain where all the bits are the same in all the nodes, when there are nodes that simply refuse to store some of the bits. In fact I think I can mathematically prove that the imposing of one person's filter into the real blockchain will do this:<br /><br />Full Blockchain vs Full Blockchain - filter0 - filter1 - filter2 - .... - filterN<br /><br />Now we have&nbsp; a swiss cheese blockchain!<br /><br />OK, so the next block is made, but actually we need to make quite a few variants of blocks to satisfy all the filtering requirements. Remember the block generator has to sign the exact block. So to make a block to appease the different filtering we need some sort of combinatoric amount of block variants.<br /><br />Now we propagate 100,000 different signed blocks to satisfy all the possible combinations of filtering requirements by all the different users (attackers)<br /><br />Please tell me how exactly we will ever get the balances to match up on all the nodes???<br /><br />AGAIN if you feel bad for the children and dont want to make their lives worse by propagating some bits about something or other, then run a lite node or run a GUI filter so you can pretend the children are protected.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I think &quot;forces people to propagate things&quot; is really quite misleading. How much work did it take you to allow the NXT node to be in sync? you are not being forced to do anything as it happens automatically, so you are not doing anything proactive to harm the children. Feel better?

Just run a lite client or a GUI filter. treat the blockchain as the networking layer (which it is)<br /><br />James

In effect, what Nxt is forcing on people to use it.<br /><br />Request: Let's add a feature that deletes the hard drive contents of anyone running Bitshares.<br /><br />Answer: No, we can't do that because it will cause damage to people's hard drives and that's not right!<br /><br />Reality: With the Marketplace we have a feature that can cause worse damage for a user than the answer above. Jail time and being prosecuted is much worse than loss of data. Data can be recovered, time can't.<br /><br />I think a Generation 3 blockchain will account for voluntary non-participation by nodes for certain types of transactions, information storage and transmittal . The difference between a Generation 2 and Generation 3 blockchain has been discovered here on this thread. Nxt can stay at Gen 2 or evolve the Gen 3.<br /><br />If Nxt becomes popular to sell drugs, weapons, credit card numbers or assassination for hire perhaps the price will go up. But, this is not a long term survival strategy and Nxt will naturally be selected out of existence.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are the creator's of word processors responsible for all the things that are written?<br /><br />The blockchain is not enforcing any marketplace actions to be done. Why not to hold the individuals who write anything illegal (is that even possible to be illegal just with words?) or who do the illegal things as the criminals, instead of the technology that was used?<br /><br />The legal issue is in the routing of bits. If bits are information, then the legal issue is in the routing of information automatically as a participant in a p2p network. I imagine there is quite a bit of caselaw about people running torrent software as they are being contaminated with all of the content in the torrent network as a participating node is possible to be routing any part of any file to anybody else. Are these passive torrent participants being prosecuted?<br /><br />I imagine from a practical point of view, only the active participants will be prosecuted. Otherwise there are 100,000+ bitcoin users that immediately need to go to trial. Of course I imagine everyone will be classified as some sort of criminal to be using anything that isnt official govt money for transactions.<br /><br />James<br />
