Send me the acct# and I will front the NXT needed to issue the needed assets<br /><br />I just browsed xrptalk and it was sad <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br />so many people in denial. I want to sponsor a rippler outreach program. As you have found out NXT has everything ripple/XRP has and a lot more, without any of the corporate nonsense. This whole Jed thing is due to the corporate policies that perverted the original idea of ripple into essentially a multicurrency paypal.<br /><br />Their software is still buggy, they dont have any dedicated devs, just 9 to 5 guys pulling down big salaries, until the lack of funds from the massive burn rate and the Jed buyout starts the layoffs. Maybe in a year, out of the ashes XRP2 will be born, but then again maybe ripple will just fizzle out like datacoin.<br /><br />to make people feel at home, we can even issue an XRP asset! I think we can make 100 billion of them <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />Then we can give all ex-ripplers a bunch of XRP assets. A lot of good people being cast out of the official forum and just ignored, thats no place to hang around. make them all NXTers!<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ripple's top-down strategy of engaging with the existing financial world is a legitimate one and a big differentiator from all the other altcoins.&nbsp; It takes a corporation to engage with the banks on their level.&nbsp; A foundation or a distributed group of devs would have a very hard time doing that.&nbsp; Whether or not it works is a different question, one which will be answered in time.&nbsp; The other bottom-up community-based approach is that which is being taken by Nxt.&nbsp; It is also a legitimate approach.&nbsp; And, it has had some obvious successes with the recent growth.&nbsp; It'll be good to see a couple of fiat/nxt gateways or exchanges open up over the coming months.<br /><br />I think it is good for both to have the competition of the other.&nbsp; They are actually quite similar at their cores.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>From a distance they could be seen as similar, but yet they are so different. The difference is a lot more than just the tech. Since NXT has no structure it sometimes struggles to get things done in a focused manner, then again it is possible for a few people to take charge and just make things happen. There is no real structure to prevent things from getting done. Also, NXT tech is evolving at a very fast pace. While ripple struggles to just complete the basics, NXT is expanding in all areas of tech features.<br /><br />payexpo.com seems to be full of bankers and I think NXT is the crytocurrency sponsor and ripple isnt even there.<br /><br />As time goes on, even stuffy corporate banks will start to use bitcoin and once they cross that barrier what stops them from using NXT? I estimate the NXT community being about 10 times bigger than ripple's and that is counting the ripple devs, but not their non-devs.<br /><br />The following stats should be a big contrast to ripple forum(s)<br /><br />40398 Posts in 2228 Topics by 1139 Members.<br />Users Online<br />30 Guests, 36 Users (4 Hidden)<br />Most Online Today: 94. Most Online Ever: 269 (June 05, 2014, 02:16:46 pm)<br /><br />24x7 there are dozens in this forum around 4000 posts per week.This compares to just a few people on the ripple boards at any given time.<br /><br />So, this means that NXT will have a lot more people offering products and services based on NXT than ripple ever will and I know many of those products and services will be oriented toward the financial sector. So, ripple has one centralized organization. NXT will have dozens and eventually hundreds of &quot;companies&quot; each in their own niche<br /><br />James<br />

That would be like somebody dumping 1.5 billion NXT, mathematical impossibility and 30 times larger than what is possible.<br /><br />

Annual return on forging is around half percent. so 5 million NXT per year = ~13700/day<br />These numbers might be higher since the AE issue fee is 1000 NXT<br /><br />fees are really just spam prevention, but if you have a zillion NXT you can get enough to pay for a decent server

Of course, if all NXTers start zapping NXT out to their credit cards, then the dividends should more than payoff the investment in a reasonable timeframe.<br /><br />James

I want to sponsor a rippler outreach program. As you have found out NXT has everything ripple/XRP has and a lot more, without any of the corporate nonsense. This whole Jed thing is due to the corporate policies that perverted the original idea of ripple into essentially a multicurrency paypal.<br /><br />Their software is still buggy, they dont have any dedicated devs, just 9 to 5 guys pulling down big salaries, until the lack of funds from the massive burn rate and the Jed buyout starts the layoffs. Maybe in a year, out of the ashes XRP2 will be born, but then again maybe ripple will just fizzle out like datacoin.<br /><br />to make people feel at home, we can even issue an XRP asset! I think we can make 100 billion of them <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />Then we can give all ex-ripplers a bunch of XRP assets.

I'm not sure if it's to do with the installer or what. I have version07 working fine on my main computer, but to test this new build, I did a fresh install on my laptop. Laptop is running 32bit Vista, same as my main machine.<br /><br />Sometimes (usually the first time) NXTservices seems to work okay. Calc_Dividends works. However, when I search on NXTorrent, I can't find any listings. I was able to add a listing, but then that was the only one I could find when I searched. No sign of the rest of the listings which should be there.<br /><br />That seems minor enough, but when I try again, it fails badly. After it runs through the assets, I get as follows:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">start_NXTloops<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />Start coinloop<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getState)<br />NOT GOOD. retries.10 total retries.148, numcurls.47629 numrecovered.19 numfails.11<br />ERROR submitting cmd.(requestType=getState)<br />start RT NXTloop numforging.0 from ()<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt (null) requestType=getTime)<br />NOT GOOD. retries.10 total retries.158, numcurls.47630 numrecovered.19 numfails.12<br />ERROR submitting cmd.(requestType=getTime)<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt?requestType=getBlock&amp;block= (null) (null))<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt?requestType=getBlock&amp;block= (null) (null))<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt?requestType=getBlock&amp;block= (null) (null))<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt?requestType=getBlock&amp;block= (null) (null))<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt?requestType=getBlock&amp;block= (null) (null))<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt?requestType=getBlock&amp;block= (null) (null))<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt?requestType=getBlock&amp;block= (null) (null))<br />curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server curl.(http://127.0.0.1:6876/nxt?requestType=getBlock&amp;block= (null) (null))<br />retries.8 total retries.166, numcurls.47631 numrecovered.20 numfails.12<br /></code><br />Now, I often see several fails to connect to server curl, so maybe that means nothing.

So if the missed commands happened to be asset transfer, you will get bad results.<br />If you have non-zero numfails, that could explain all the strange behavior<br /><br />also, before it is caught up, the 127.0.0.1 page wont show<br />all these curl errors are caused by NXTservices being too fast, I might have to increase the delay between requests<br />

Could you give estimates for all the various services?<br /><br />I am just trying to get a feel for things so, maybe a conservative estimate, expected estimate and optimistic estimate, where conservative estimate is the number you are almost certain you will achieve and optimistic is if everything goes right.<br /><br />So, one year down the road, what do you for overall daily revenues using these three methods?<br />If you can break it down by service category, that would be even better. I think with some realistic projections, the NXT community will become much more eager to purchase your asset. As it is, all we see is ~10 BTC per day.<br /><br />James
