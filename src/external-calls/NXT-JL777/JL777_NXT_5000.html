People just want to know how much they earned and as long as they can rely on being able to redeem at anytime, they can decide when they want to pay the 1 NXT txfee. If you can accept PM's for redemption requests, that saves another 1 NXT so they dont have to send an AM<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. That is how the nodecoin redemption will work, the GUI will display accrued nodecoins and when you want them sent to your acct, you just press a button. In my case it will have to be all automated, so I might have to have people send 1 NXT to cover the transfer fee, but in your case it is already in NXT, so you can just deduct the 1 NXT

At the end of the IPO (with extention or not), to burn the rest of the shares will you distribute the rest of shares proportionnaly among the initial stakeholder? So that the total 10 millions shares will be in circulation among all the stakeholders? The initial market cap would then be smaller than 5 millions NXT.<br /><br />What I do not want to happen is that very large part of the shares stay within a single hand, even if there is a promise that new shares will never dilute the market, that would not be securing for the stakeholder. For exemple, I don't think you can burn shares by sending the shares to the genesis account (I am wrong?).<br /><br />Thank again for your time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>sending to genesis effectively burns them<br />I've done it

					DRK has finally gotten a bit tired and has come down a bit. As I expected it found strong support at .02<br />The round numbers are particularly common as support/resistance simply because it is easy to put in orders at those prices. People tend to like round numbers.<br /><br />Never underestimate the trend. It aint over till its over,or something like that.<br />So, what makes a trend. If you are seeing higher highs then it is an uptrend. Nothing goes in a straight line and after a big run up, it is expected to drop back. The key is how far back. If it drops below the previous peak, then maybe its found its new level and will oscillate, or maybe even drop down another notch<br /><br />If you look at the chart, DRK is really stretching the peaks,its not really even a peak, but .019 is the last peaklike thing, so combine that with the psychological .02 and we now have our trigger. These are also close to the long term dilution ratio against NXT. Basically if DRK goes to .02 we are expecting either a bounce or a drop.<br /><br />Long term I am believer in crypto, so I dont want to reduce my DRK holdings even if it does fall through the .02 level. I will use it to accumulate more. I feel 0.25% to be the core holdings level. Maybe silly, but BTC itself isnt feeling so solid long term, so diversification seems best.<br /><br />So, two possible near future scenarios. DRK solidifies its &gt; .02 price and hovers around .02 and .025 and at some point people adjust their view on what is expensive for DRK and it can climb again. Stairstep fashion toward LTC market cap.<br /><br />Or, it doesnt stay above .02 and then drops down to the .015 to .02 range. If it drops below .015 in the near term I would be surprised. Not sure where I will come back in,eg.dont try to catch falling knifes! Wait for it to settle and stop the downtrend. <br /><br />A key factor in all this are all the DRK wannabes. Not sure if people are actually copying me, but little traded ANC is up 40% today already, MRO is holding steady. Basically no matter which anon crypto wins, sharkfund has a nice sized chunk of it already. I am not smart enough to know which one will win, so I just got a bit of all of them<br /><br />James<br /><br /><br /><br />

Some individuals control enough NXT to crash the price if they decided to dump in a fit of pique. Don't all cryptocurrencies have that vulnerability today?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Nobody has 100 times the daily liquidity to dump,that requires a certain special hatred, to destroy millions of dollars of wealth out of spite. Hard to imagine NXT founder feeling that way toward the NXT community.<br />Even if they did, ~4 days of liquidity would certainly drop the price, but unlike XRP, there are many people who would just be so happy if NXT were to drop to .000025,so it wont stay there long. <br /><br />Remember, XRP used to be ~15 per dollar and stabilized at ~25/dollar. As ripple sold XRP at a 10% discount to their preferred partners, the price dropped 90% to ~150 to 1. Now the price is&nbsp; ~300 XRP per USD on weak demand. If RL doesnt work out a deal, price goes to zero for a month! Actually forever as who would tolerate that. So RL has to repurchase, half their capital gone, no more investors, big layoffs.<br /><br />NXT is global, I estimate now over 100 people actively developing in NXT. How can there be layoffs in NXT due to price drop? Sure some people would get discouraged and move on, but NXT is the king of second gen. Smart guys work for the leader.<br /><br />Most altcoins are proud if they have one fulltime dev!<br />And yes, all cryptos have significant holders that can crash the price temporarily or permanently. This is why you need to assess the community of the coin before investing.<br /><br />James

If you're poor, then you can't afford to run a forging node 24/7. The cost of doing that would be greater than the rewards from forging. Leasing pools help, because they effectively cap the cost at 1 NXT per 32000 blocks (plus 2 NXT to withdraw, but you don't have to pay that every month), but you still need a minimum number of NXT before leasing is worthwhile. I currently have about 20,000 NXT, and I don't think it's enough. I'm poor so my return is zero.<br /><br />Hopefully this will improve as the number of transactions increases, but there will always be a level of poverty below which forging is uneconomical. Poor people pay transaction fees, and the fees go to richer people. I'm not saying this can or should be fixed; it's just how it is now.<br /><br />(Bitcoin is the same or arguably worse, because only rich people can afford mining rigs, and poor people get penalised by inflation as well as by fees. And the fees will surely be higher as the block reward halves. Someone has to pay for all the work that Proof of Work implies, and that someone is poor people.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What is your feedback on various whale accts donating all of their forged revenues?<br />I thought that would stop all this rich vs poor talk, but it didnt seem to have much effect<br />As a result, I think the whales (rightly) decided to just keep the massive 0.5% per year for themselves to giveaway directly to people they felt were deserving.<br />These are pennies peoples!<br />It is to prevent blockchain spam<br />Please do not start envy war over it<br />Forging is not a way to get rich, just a way to keep the network safe.<br />Its enough to keep servers running and paying for their costs, but like you say not much more than that.<br /><br />So, why all the envy?<br /><br />James

From what I'm reading, you seem to be saying that a withdrawal request is initiated from the AE. Is that right? However, it seems to me that from within the AE, it's only possible to transfer the asset around between NXT accounts, and that to withdraw, you'll have to initiate a redeem request via the MGW gui.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You would initiate a withdraw by sending the asset back to the ASSET ISSUER NXT account owned by MGW - in order to balance the MGW would need to transfer the real coins from the multi-sig wallet to your registered withdrawal address.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks. (See my edit above, I have two further questions)<br />1) Can't you just monitor the MWG NXT account looking for transactions, rather than all the NXT blocks? and 2) What happens if a NXT account that has never deposited does the withdrawal (the asset was just transferred to them), they'll then have no deposit address?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>In scenarios where there are more than a certain number of accounts, it is much less work to just decode each block and all the tx inside it than poll every NXT acct to see if it got any changes.<br />Additionally NXTservices is tracking all assets, so much simpler and less API calls to just process all blocks<br /><br />Withdrawals MUST be done from a preregistered NXT acct, the one that requested the multisig address<br />The withdraw function currently creates a tokenized request that can only be created by the NXT acct that is requesting the withdraw. Otherwise anybody can withdraw anybody elses funds. I thought that would be bad.<br /><br />So that is why it is a two step process. You click the button to get the URL and paste it into the browser. Of course, we need a GUI to automate this, but private key always stays local.

For our own org chart purposes, every project can be seen as a subset within TEAM, but thinking about the Nxt Community as a whole, I don't think any type of TEAM branding should stay between Nxt and services like mgw, subatomic or instantdex. <br /><br />Let me use an example. I'm starting to work in the mgw site since it appears to be closer in the horizon than other services. And the idea is to use the Nxt stylesheet, for an informative website aimed to both the current Nxt community (as an introduction to the mgw service in the Nxt platform) and new Nxt users (as an introduction to both the mgw service for crypto trading AND the Nxt platform). We can start to work in multigateway.com although perhaps we'll have a mgw.nxt.org redirect once the service is fully operational. <br /><br />Down the road, once several projects and services are working, we'll see if a TEAM web portal makes sense, but whether we like the idea or not, aiming right now to create a big top down TEAM website sounds premature since projects are in an early stage of development and it wouldn't make much sense from the point of view of the user. To make progress along with development, I'd rather go bottom up.<br /><br />Tomorrow I have a meeting with the website developer, I have to introduce her to many new concepts since she's not familiar with the crypto scene, and for starters I was aiming to a multigateway site as the first milestone.<br /><br />So please, if you have suggestions and you want to discuss this, any TEAM input will be appreciated soon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>bottom up for end users first<br /><br />TEAM is an aggregation of all that we do. As such it is too diverse and complicated for anyone to fully understand. The investors will rely on summary financial data and they wont really care about a website,just as long as it is available in a timely fashion<br /><br />

Problem is I can't keep my eye on everything because crypto is more of an investment hobby for me - my time is spent in other pursuits. Otherwise, I'd love a good trading contest.<br /><br />See, if I had been paying attention, I would have bought DRK pre exchange when it was 1/500th of the price it is now. But, alas, I was off doing other things. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Btw, while we are chatting, I want to thank you for carrying the NXT torch for so many of us. Without people like you this thing could have run off the rails and be dead by now. Now, there is a real chance that NXT will have a place in history.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am just one guy, granted I work around the clock, but still there are dozens and dozens of people working on NXT. NXT is only behind BTC in the number of active people who work on it.<br /><br />It is the caliber of people in the NXT community and also the number of them that allows the creation of a mini-crypto economy. Now I predict more and more people will come to NXT and it will just keep growing and growing. Not necessarily the price as that will always be a roller coaster, but each new person that helps NXT adds value that will eventually get reflected in the price.<br /><br />Unlike other cryptos, NXT has the full spectrum of people from all walks of life. That creates the ability for us to do pretty much anything.<br /><br />And we will<br /><br />James
