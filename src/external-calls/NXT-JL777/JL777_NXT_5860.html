Doing this will allow no way for buyers to report abuses by sellers.<br />I think we have some sort of Judgement System in the works. Maybe a seller can just dispute baseless negative feedbacks.

					fanaticalfishing has been great and providing server resources, so I am assuming I wont have to worry about the multigateway production server costs. I will let him deal with getting the fundings.<br /><br />Back to servers for my development. As you know I am working on a large number of projects and having a small server farm really helped me develop and test some pretty important things. I have been forced to scale things down dramatically and am currently down to 10 servers, but I will not be able to pay for all of them for more than a month.<br /><br />With 10 servers, I can simulate hundreds and thousands of nodes, but if I have to scale down to 3 servers (the bare minimum), then it will impact development of things NXT and considering the difficulty in finding technical testers, if I cant create larger scale simulations, it could really affect time to complete projects.<br /><br />So, I would like to propose 1 BTC per month equivalent of NXT for my development and test servers. This would let me continue trying out many things and deploying scalable testnet releases of experimental new features.<br /><br />Much appreciated if I can get an answer before the end of the month<br /><br />James<br />

					I have been working on a lot of different projects, some of them based on announced bounty (NXTcash, NXTorrent), some of them via virtual company (InstantDEX) and some based on personal sponsorship from neer.g<br /><br />neer.g's sponsorship is the umbrella that I am developing multigateway under and the sponsorship will expire in mid-May. However, as long as we get enough testers to get me bug reports, I should be able to get it stabilized and released by then.<br /><br />chanc3r is doing a thorough source review and he should get a bounty. multigateway is pretty important for NXT as it is a key differentiator over all the other asset exchanges and clones. I would also like to offer a bounty for btc2nxt to test multigateway, he has proven he is good at finding bugs via API, which is what multigateway needs.<br /><br />If you feel I deserve some bounty in addition to what I got from neer.g (~180,000 NXT) as the neer.g sponsorship was for general NXT work and not specifically multigateway, then I certainly wont complain, but we really should take care of chanc3r and get btc2nxt involved.<br /><br />James<br />

					chanc3r is getting in to high gear and starting to find some bugs. I didnt state any specify bounty for bugs found, but he has definitely earned it!<br /><br />For finding memory leaks and a host of small issues, he got 1000 NXT<br />I am no BCNext, so there will be plenty of bugs for people to find. No guarantees on amounts paid, but the more severe the problem you find, the more you will get.<br /><br />James

It also provides a differentiator from clones as secure servers need to be setup.<br /><br />Now what I dont see any marketing peoples understand is a bit perplexing. The fact that mastercoin and XCP asset exchanges didnt take the world by storm is obvious to me. The 10+ minute blocktime. You simple cant trade cryptos at that time frame.<br /><br />Now, without waiting for 1000TPS, we can right now, immediately start pushing the FASTEST Decentralized Asset Exchange. 10 times faster in fact. If the marketing people cant use this to get some significant attention, well we need to fix that.<br /><br />So, NXT AE is 10 times faster than the competition (can we really even use that word for something 10 times slower?) and it will be getting multisig protected crypto assets AND it will be getting even faster.<br /><br />Any talk of doom and gloom about NXT is basically FUD. There is no need to panic. NXT is not AUR. If you want pump and dump, buy whatever changed color from red to green on coinmarketcap. That's usually good for 20%+ short term gain. Just dont complain if you get caught in the dump and lose 75%!<br /><br />NXT has the most man years of development of any crypto other than BTC. I believe this will continue. I once read that a crypto's value is best measured by the number of developers.<br /><br />anyway, I have shown it is possible to slam together a functional NXT service in one day with the NXTorrent. Sure it doesnt have a completed GUI yet, but if we can setup a GUI factory and a test lab, then we can create a big pipeline of new NXT services.<br /><br />James

Will there be a big gap of releasedates or could it be ready at the same time?<br /><br />If you can answer this we can decide about it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I cant release multigateway before AE as it depends on it<br />Also, there has been very little testing of multigateway by anybody other than me, so I am not comfortable with its stability yet. source review is proceeding and it could uncover some things that require some time.<br /><br />Realistically, the guys testing AE need to finish testing AE so we can get that launched. Then hopefully they will be able to validate multigateway for release. It is really a matter of getting the tests, but there seem to be very few people for that...<br /><br />So, simultaneous release is not practical. There will be a version running on testnet, but we also need to get production servers deployed and hardened. Again this will take some time. The more testers, the faster. Currently there doesnt seem to be anybody testing other than me, so it will be a long time<br /><br />James

Keep up the good work man! If we do this project right nxt will be the talk of the town.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am verifying some last tests before making multigateway test release. I will include NXTorrent in the same release, so people can test both.<br /><br />Still Mac only. I guess I need to get it working on Ubuntu also.<br /><br />So far, I havent heard any real bugs. Do you have a spec on the type of searching you want? I think once that is defined, the API generates an array of listings for the GUI to display, and then once sephr gets me the aria2, we will have magnet link support and category searching.<br /><br />If we let people specify their listing as category A, subcategory B, sub-subcategory C, it can be free form and self-organizing. I could always break the hierarchy by allowing matches for a search filter to any of the A, B or C listing categories.<br /><br />So, there would need to be a new API call, getCategories. It could list all categoryA as a default. If a category is input, it would list all subcategories of categoryA. If categoryA and B are given, then the third level associated with CategoryA+B will be returned.<br /><br />I think this solves the category problem and it is self-organizing. The GUI can start by getting showing all the top level categories. When the user clicks a link, it would display the subcategories and so on.<br /><br />The only issue I see with this is that there could be too many high level categories if we allow it to be totally free form. Maybe just super high level sections? <br /><br />James

(50K/15mil = 0.003) If total emu were to increase by 10,000 emu, 5,000 emu go to hatchers and 5,000 emu to holders. Your share of the 5,000 would be 15 new emu.

					Finally!<br />I have BTC, LTC, DOGE and DRK all running and deposits work for all. I got asset transfers working for BTC and DOGE, and it probably works for the others too, just havent tested it yet.<br /><br />Withdraw request also works and the last roadblock was that multisig withdrawal stopped working. It turns out bitcoind is pretty braindead when it comes to multisig and it doesnt even seem to know that it exists. However, you can still send it low level commands and if you just happen to have all the vins, vouts, unspents, etc. correct with proper keys (public and private), redeemscripts and scriptPubKey, then the transaction will go through. At least I just got a manual one to work.<br /><br />So now, I have to tweak my rawtransaction code to compensate and I will be really close to being able to make a release for Mac's<br /><br />James

Then no matter what happens, you always have the option of converting the Y newcoin back into X NXT.<br /><br />Let's say that this newcoin is actually asset backed, eg. multigateway BTC. Assuming that the market price is 20000 NXT for BTC, this newcoin would actually be worth significantly more!!<br /><br />Let us assume we trust the multigateway to redeem the BTC, so its value should never go below the value of BTC. But, it is also always worth 20000 NXT. This is basically BTC + put option @ 20000 NXT that never expires. It is worth the greater of 20000 NXT or 1 BTC. Some black+scholes values could be used to approximate a multiyear option, but my guess is that it is quite significant.<br /><br />Now, this value simply appears out of nowhere!!!<br /><br />That's some pretty powerful feature. It essentially lets us mint options without any risk for any other asset.<br /><br />Now, I think if the reverse was allowed, eg. burning NXT to get newcoin, that is equivalent to a call option. However, we cant let anybody do it at anytime and there has to be a BTC that is also tied to it.<br /><br />I am busy debugging multigateway now, so hopefully some of you can figure out how to create pure put and all options with clever combining of monetary system coins with assets. <br /><br />With clever usage of the NXT -&gt; newcoin -&gt; NXT mechanism,all sorts of powerful things can be created. I hope CfB will implement monetary system to allow for varying the behavior as I cannot figure out all the use cases.<br /><br />James
