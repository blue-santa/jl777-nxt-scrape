					I am in the process of migrating the testNXT assets to mainnet.<br /><br /><br />I will regenerate the multisig addresses for the following accounts:<br /><br />&quot;15354966263746745810&quot;,<br />&quot;7926777737834261541&quot;,<br />&quot;3079450277578176702&quot;,<br />&quot;8989816935121514892&quot;,<br />&quot;436167283068724902&quot;,<br />&quot;9487276358138478978&quot;,<br />&quot;1891847335916678972&quot;,<br />&quot;10752316034725130293&quot;,<br />&quot;15347973406773363236&quot;,<br />&quot;2299216276842660095&quot;,<br />&quot;287454778497342628&quot;,<br />&quot;12744250530211679183&quot;,<br />&quot;7981939800072910413&quot;,<br /><br />They will end up being the same deposit addresses (at least plz report a bug if it is different)<br /><br />I have already seeded all the accounts with the same amounts of assets in the testNXT version, except for:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NXT&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;2299216276842660095&quot;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;name&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;BTC&quot;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;qty&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;0.00000300&quot;,<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NXT&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;436167283068724902&quot;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;name&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;BTC&quot;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;maxtimestamp&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1073741824,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;qty&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;0.00000542&quot;,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NXT&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;7926777737834261541&quot;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;name&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;BTC&quot;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;qty&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;0.00000002&quot;,<br /><br />and some LTC dust. Now LTC is a bit different because it only has 4 digits and MGW will round down so any fifth digit or more will become a donation to MGW.<br />Also, there is a total of 9 BTC and 90 LTC of assets across the three MGW servers. If you deposit more than that it will fail, though I believe it will pick it up when I restock the MGW acct. Anyway, just limit deposits to 0.1 BTC max and 1 LTC max and there should be no problems<br /><br />It will take a few hours to get the MGW servers ready and then I will make NXTservices_v08c and NXTservices_m08c, the latter is for mainnet and will use real NXT and real BTC and real LTC. MGW is still experimental.<br /><br />James<br />

I suppose the assets would need to represent some form of right to delivery or ownership of the underlying assets held in jl777hodl?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There isnt a mechanism to do this right now, but I guess that would solve the issue. Great idea!<br /><br />If someone wants to pay the transfer fees for all the assets (~20 NXT) and can wait until I either automate the process or do it manually, for a large enough redemption I can convert the jl777hodl for the corresponding amount of its holdings. I think if I sent the redeemed amount to the genesis acct, it all balances out. There will also be rounding issues as many assets dont have decimals, so maybe some sort of horse trading at equivalent market price to make it all balance out. Anyway, many details to sort but all very possible.<br /><br />Can somebody verify this for me?<br /><br />Since this is a one way operation and time consuming, I dont want it to be happening all the time. The key point is that jl777hodl represents its prorata share of its holdings. So, if anybody wants to redeem a large amount of jl777hodl, just PM me and we can work out the details.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I fully agree with you that the standard way of getting in and out of the asset should be via trading it on the asset exchange. And the transparency of <a href="http://nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-2AHU-UXZW-K9Q2-HENLW&amp;c=USD" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-2AHU-UXZW-K9Q2-HENLW&amp;c=USD</a> and the option for justified (i.e. covering tx costs and other expenses) redemption give it a well defined value.&nbsp; So thank you for clarifying. It seems to be a nice investment option to get exposure to a variety of NXT assets.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thank you for asking such a good question<br />i will also try to provide more liquidity centered around the nxtreporting.com value to minimize the need for redemptions as that is clearly the best way

Unless people are thinking the GoCoin presenter at payexpo was an actor hired by john?<br /><br />So, let us assume innocent until proven guilty. So far, the only guilt I see proven is that john had his email hacked.

How many PM's or posts from cointropolis is only one line long?<br />Since he had access to email and PM's, it wouldnt be that hard to cut and paste similar text that john actually wrote. All he needed to do was insert the key 25% and BTC address to text based on what john wrote in the past<br /><br />It could be that the text is 90% john's so things like ~ and one liner PM are significant clues<br />From testimony of people that personally know john, it is supremely unlikely that john is actually a criminal mastermind techie that can create this scam while on the plane, log into Tor and submit it while in transit and change his writing style so that it looks like it is someone trying to look like someone who is emulating another's writing style.<br /><br />If cointroplois had all these skills, I doubt he would be so hardworking as he would already have lots of BTC gained from master scams.<br /><br />James

My guess is that it is a forum member that is always lurking, gathering intel. Now NXT is #3, we will have this to deal with so we need to be diligent.<br /><br />But during a weekend sunday, unprecedented 400 BTC offer that sounds too good to be true. I really feel bad I didnt put it together until 1.5 hrs after the scam started. In my defense I didnt even see this thread until it was already underway and BTC was already accumulating, plus I didnt even have my coffee yet.<br /><br />James

When MGW is ready for full production mode, bithaus will be hosting one of the MGW servers, but this is totally independent of the fiat gateway services

Great idea!<br /><br />If someone wants to pay the transfer fees for all the assets (~20 NXT) and can wait until I either automate the process or do it manually, for a large enough redemption I can convert the jl777hodl for the corresponding amount of its holdings. I think if I sent the redeemed amount to the genesis acct, it all balances out. There will also be rounding issues as many assets dont have decimals, so maybe some sort of horse trading at equivalent market price to make it all balance out. Anyway, many details to sort but all very possible.<br /><br />Can somebody verify this for me?<br /><br />Since this is a one way operation and time consuming, I dont want it to be happening all the time. The key point is that jl777hodl represents its prorata share of its holdings. So, if anybody wants to redeem a large amount of jl777hodl, just PM me and we can work out the details.<br /><br />James

This just eliminates one more change between the production MGW servers and my development version.<br /><br />Now what this means is that with the understanding that the development MGW servers are prone to my isp disconnecting and getting killed and there still could be bugs, etc. if people want to deposit and trade for real, I will do my best to support it. So far, even during the early beta where withdraws get stuck, I have been able to beat most of the centralized exchange's withdraw times. bter is the only one faster than me when I have to track down and solve bugs<br /><br />When we do move servers, there will be some amount of downtime to extract the multisig deposits from the development servers and transfer it to the production servers.<br /><br />So, maybe on this otherwise dark day, we can have some mainnet excitement of a positive nature. Once the assets get into your acct, all the trading is via NXT AE, so the risk points are on deposit and withdraw. There is also a chance that MGW will issue duplicate asset transfers or withdraws and I hope people will understand that I will want to fix the error and hope for cooperation to recover any lost amounts. So far, the total lost amounts have been 1 BTC satoshi and 1 LTC satoshi, but that is from someone using 32bit win7.<br /><br />James<br /><br />When I deploy mainnet MGW, the existing balances will be carried over on the bitcoind side, but not the NXT AE side, so I will issue dividends of the mainnet asset to the corresponding accts. Make sure to login to the testnet acct on mainnet and transfer the asset to a mainnet test acct if you are not comfortable using the same testing acct. Also, NXTservices displays acct passwords for debugging locally so be VERY careful if you are posting screenshots as it could contain your mainnet password. I do recommend just using the same testnet acct number as that will probably be a small value acct<br />

You mean the forum GUI? Yes that should be possible, but most people probably won't want it. (Most use remember me functionality and that wouldn't work with this scheme due to the recent timestamp issue you mention). It would be cumbersome.<br /><br />A plugin could perhaps be created that allows one to add a token on thread creation time, and have the server automatically validate it..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I meant web GUI to have a link that opens up and logs into the forum. Then forum logins would be as secure as NXT acct<br />it would be a mode for the forum that enables automatic tokenized passwords so for people that dont do this it still works<br />then just a display to show if someone has logged in via token<br /><br />i guess maybe too much work...
