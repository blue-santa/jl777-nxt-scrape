This package can be anything, eg. NXT acct.<br />If M is 51, then majority is needed, etc.<br /><br />Now maybe some people are more equal than others so they would get more than one piece. Someone with 10% control would get 10 pieces, etc. Then you have corporate voting mechanism to unlock package.<br /><br />So, not exactly multisig, but I am no a core guy (at least in NXT) so this is the best I can do.<br /><br />People can donate to N different people, M of which are needed to cash in the donation. With proper selection of people and their roles (auditor, treasurer, executive, etc.) any sort of financial control can be made.<br /><br />But with so few interest in this, I guess I will prioritize supporting BTC first<br /><br />James

I assume you'll want to automate as much as possible. However, there'll probably need to be code maintenance and user support at a minimum for some of them. And someone will have to manage all that. If some of these companies turn into multi-million enterprises, there will surely need to be some corporate structure put in place.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So does that mean when NXT becomes a lot bigger, NXT will have to incorporate too?<br />I do not understand your logic. If it is automated, processing $1000 or $1000000 is not so much different. Maybe a few more servers, oh, its decentralized so it doesnt use its own servers. Maybe more office space, nope, no needing of office space<br /><br />I do agree there will need to be more people for support, but if it is making such millions, then how is this a problem? I arrange to pay people for the work that they do. Do I need a corporation to use the &quot;send NXT&quot; command? If they need fiat, they ask to be paid to their credit card or anon card address.<br /><br />I dont think you fully understand the implications of what I am creating.<br />Automate as much as possible, then there will be people/companies that I can pay to take care of what isnt automated<br /><br />Having no fixed overhead means even if revenues are small, that's OK. If revenues are high, then portion of revenues pays for incremental costs. There is no need for a nation state to give seal of approval and allow to have all the rules entangle everything. Anyway, what country to incorporation in?<br /><br />I choose NXT nation!<br /><br />James

I've probably lost 1 or 2 dollars, but I never used that exchange again. I'm insisting since I care about transparency and trust. I am not saying that the fees are too high (actually, I think they are too low), but that we must be absolutely transparent in what the user can expect.<br /><br />I've just done another full-round (deposit and withdrawal):<br /><br />User initiated withdrawal over 21.46 VIAassets<br />Recipient account received 21.259 VIA<br />Difference -&gt; 0.204<br />&nbsp; 0.1 of the diff that went into the fee acount<br />&nbsp; 0.1 of the diff went back to deposit account, but is of course not available to the user<br /><br /><br />Ok, I think now I got it.

With the fix for the dust transactions, it is getting out of balance, but in favor of MGW. This makes sense as it really should have gone out as the MGW fee, but it got put into the virtual wallet. So if you keep doing the dust tx, then yes the MGW credit balance will keep growing.<br /><br />You can set the fees in MGW.conf<br />I do not believe there is an error in calculating the fee, so I am not sure what your issue is<br /><br />James

Of course your main focus should be coding, but since there is so much NXT going around in your assets and they are becoming increasingly important, you might also want to start paying attention at providing that kind of information.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Note to people asking questions: this is no witch hunt topic. At this point it is clear that almost no asset issuer has super detailed information about their assets. That is a work in progress. We need to keep this civil.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>what does it mean to &quot;cooperate with asset rating site&quot;?<br />I am making automated decentralized money making systems. Understand the software and not sure what else matters. deposits will come to crypto accts, then get distributed out.<br />I dont have fixed overhead, though I am spending little bits here and there on some contractors for stuff I am not so good at, so without office space or salaries or any traditional costs, my operating asset companies will have pretty high gross profit margins<br /><br />As to what the expected revenue levels are, well that is not something that is easy to estimate and I doubt any asset rating site would be able to do this with any more accuracy than most people. So, the investors are making some leap of faith that I will finish the tech. And that compared to real world company valuations, all of my assets are really quite undervalued, especially when you consider the low overhead.<br />I read some company just got $12 million in VC funding to develop multisig wallets. Hmmm. I did MGW by myself and I didnt raise anywhere close to that! So are the VC guys idiots or are some assets still undervalued?<br /><br />All depends on future NXT growth (actually a lot of my assets are bringing in new business into NXT, so more overall crypto growth with NXT growth an added bonus)<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I have tried to answer every question anybody has ever had about any of my assets. I just have so many things to do, I dont find time to document anything other than responding to questions. Hope that will suffice as I must keep coding

What is it about James's asset/s that gives you value? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see results of his hard working and his good will to help people in difficult situations!<br />Also like overall concept of NXT Services. <br />His github is accessible. And MGW released already.<br /><br />Along with that I admit that the human being of James is the fragile part of all his assets and development.<br />Thou it&#039;ll be good to hear some answers from him:<br /><a href="https://nxtforum.org/assets-board/james&#039;-assets/msg77567/#new" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/assets-board/james&#039;-assets/msg77567/#new</a><br /><br />I don&#039;t need to convince you, my choice is mine, think for yourself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Nicely put. I couldn't agree more. He is actually an &quot;amazing machine&quot;, and without doubt has significant value......somewhere. Problem for me, not only do i not see any 'assets', i am wondering how on earth value could be derived, when surrounded, and participating in 75% worth of shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>value will come from lifetime future revenues.<br />For example, InstantDEX will be charging 1/1024 as commission to each side. Half of that goes to asset holders, the other half is revenue sharing among various other entities.<br />NXTprivacy will be charging 1/1024 of the BTC that it teleports<br />tradebots will allow high frequency trading on InstantDEX<br />Privatebet will charge 1% fees of the amounts bet using a peer to peer and private (teleport based) system<br /><br />so these assets are a matter of me finishing them, I estimate end of year for most of them with the first ones being done in a month or so. Maybe some people dont think I will ever finish anything, but keep in mind I only started coding all this end of Feb, so about 5 months. For projects of the complexity I am doing, that is not that much time and I believe that I will finish half a dozen of these projects in about a year, so maybe I could have finished them serially a bit sooner for one or two, but no way to finish one every two months.<br /><br />Look at dotcom stocks, how many even just survived? Pick your assets carefully and some will do better than NXT itself. Choose randomly and, well, we see what can happen. Still there are newcomers with good assets, so it is not just about how long they have been around.<br /><br />James<br /><br />

					As I was coding Teleport, I figured out how to add multisig to it.<br />I am not 100% sure as it is after long day, but I am pretty sure that M of N multisig for NXT can be done outside the core and I should have it done this month. These multisigs would be N up to 254 and also could be made reasonably private.<br /><br />I should have some test results by this weekend to prove this out.<br /><br />James

I have asked anon136 to hold the unbound assets and vanbreuk is already managing the operating budget. So for MGW, my demise would mean a loss of ~200K NXT. Not a major loss.<br /><br />My other work is regularly updated to github, so theoretically anybody can pick up where I leave off, though realistically I would expect there to be some sort of learning curve as there is ~40,000 lines of new code already<br /><br />I have trusted other people and let them manage significant amounts of NXT, with mixed results. At this point I think the odds of my not dying are better than trusting anybody else with access to key accounts.<br /><br />Now I just implemented multisig support into Teleport and I should be able to provide M of 254 multisig for NXT this month. (yes without any core changes) Once that is in place, then a lot of the morbid scenarios can be handled using multisig. So, just hope nothing bad happens to me for another couple months. I estimate that by year-end I will have all my current tech projects into maintenance mode and all generating some nice dividends, with multisig protected emergency access by key trusted members.<br /><br />The key to business success is to make yourself obsolete. This allows you to do more new things and leaves a trail of projects that are fully operational without direct involvement. With multisig, I can setup a checks and balances system for all significant expenditures<br /><br />James<br />

Why is change being emitted at all? Why not just send the 0.20050000 above to either the fee or the recipient account?<br /><br />2.)

Now this virtual wallet is the sum of all unspent outputs from all deposit addresses. MGW is able to tell apart internal transfers from a deposit, so even though they go to the same account, the latter generates an asset transfer while the former does not.<br /><br />Since you have so few deposit addresses, odds are high that any change goes to the deposit address of the account doing the withdraw. Just &quot;coincidence&quot; when there are more accts, it will usually just be some other deposit address
