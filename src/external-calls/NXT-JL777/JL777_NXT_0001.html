This data has to be shared between 100&#039;s and 1000&#039;s of nodes. We are talking about blockchain download which will take weeks and requires each node to run a full scale database server.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Short of a believable cancellation of fNXT this will be my last post here and I am sad it has to end this way. I am trying to help NXT, but not fNXT. However it seems that the lure of the fNXT bonus is blinding everybody to believe technical NONSENSE and if basic things like arithmetic are not done correctly, then proper economic analysis is definitely out of reach.<br /><br />I can multiply and I have common sense, maybe that is all I can do, but I can do those things. The entire justification of fNXT is the bloat, the horrible bloat.<br /><br />First that it will take weeks to download 43GB. Well, well. exaggeration much? I know there is no iguana for NXT that syncs the entire BTC 60GB blockchain in about half an hour, but even the standard bitcoind does the 60GB in a couple days. As a courtesy I have asked for the network wire protocol for NXT so I could see about adding native NXT support to iguana, but you can imagine the sounds of silence I got from that. Not that there would be the believable BC assurances or technical assistance needed. The key thing to realize is that just because NXT is so slow and inefficient in downloading the blockchain, it doesnt have to be. Maybe that is the problem that needs to be solved? <br /><br />so it is 43GB/year vs my estimate of 1GB/yr. Let us see which is more likely to be true. The size of the NXT blockchain now isnt 43GB, it is much less, more than 1GB, but about 1GB/yr. That is the entire blockchain. 200 tx per minute might well generate 43GB/yr, but historically we average much less, more like 2 to 4. It was higher when the blocktime was ~2 minutes, now it is a steady 1 minute so closer to 2 per minute.<br /><br />2 is NOT 100<br /><br />So this explains the difference of 43GB vs 1GB. But with a bit of work, only the actual transfers and trades of AE along with NXT payments can be put into the fNXT chain. Even I dont mind if all the unfilled bids/asks are pruned (after they are filled or closed!)<br /><br />So my 1GB estimates factors in a 10x growth in AE activity. Meaning the problem is 43x (or 430x) less than it is stated by the official tech representative, repeatedly. Has my proposal of only storing the net balance changes of assets even been responded to other than with a &quot;no I am not able to do it unless it will take another 2 years&quot;?<br /><br />Well, maybe java is the wrong language to use if it will take so many years? <br />Maybe a change of this magnitude should be reviewed by unbiased independent analysts? Since clearly I am not smart enough, find someone that is, pay them 10BTC to study the likely effects of fNXT on the NXT ecosystem. Nope, it has already been decided, better spend the 10BTC on something else.<br /><br />Now I will be gone, so NXT devs, it will be safe for you to announce and &quot;discuss&quot; whatever you want without worry about me pointing out stuff like 1 + 1 = 2, and that 1 is not the same as 2. And make sure to blame me for anything that goes wrong. I am surprised that I wasnt blamed for the 25% price drop since the 2.0 announcement. If BC2 was my fault, then certainly the 25% price drop must be my fault too? Who cares about the truth? Best to just blame the only one who speaks it. Maybe I am just an emotional child ranting and making no sense? Yes, that must be it.<br /><br />After all the people who brought you the 43GB and weeks to download estimate claim I am incapable of doing any significant software architecture properly, so I will just go back to completing SuperNET which now will also need an atomic cross blockchain standard for asset migration. SuperNET has a lot of NXT so I was trying to help the others. In fact I think the fNXT hardfork will create a tremendous financial windfall for anybody that understands the complex market valuation issues and is able to create tradebots. So both I and SuperNET will do just fine financially. My warnings are regarding the future of NXT. <br /><br />[for any economics types, i suggest you study the long term effects of instantly removing half the liquid money supply and locking it away into non-liquid form with a punitive tx fee 100x. hint: it wont be pretty, but hey, it will be to NXT not fNXT so who really cares?]<br /><br />I havent bothered to analyze fNXT beyond the hardfork as that presupposes NXT is already mortally wounded. But it doesnt matter!<br /><br />pump, pump, pump the fNXT<br />to da moon we go.<br />NAS has no blockchain, who cares?<br />NXT has no assets, who cares?<br />pump, pump, pump the fNXT<br />to da moon we go<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. for asset holders, do not worry: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1372879" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1372879</a><br />you can contact me in slack or BTT, or just ask someone here who is on slack.<br />&nbsp;I will do my best to protect interests of asset holders.

And making the AE transaction types different from the other child chain transactions, another compromise I cannot do.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Why are you so stubborn and close minded? This thread was opened pretending to be an open discussion for community feedback. Nothing was decided it says. Totally open to changes.<br /><br />Historically that has not been my experience. I was hopeful that after BC2 some things would change.<br /><br />Unfortunately the reality is the usual ten commandments form of discussion and you yourself state &quot;we have already spent plenty of time discussing and refining the design before announcing it publicly. The community gets to decide whether to use it, and how exactly to migrate to it.&quot;<br /><br />So, the truth is as expected and almost NOTHING is open to change. And you make arbitrary declarations like the 160 bytes hardcap without any regard to the hardships it creates to the people who have also worked very hard for NXT. Even to the point of making it so they decide they cant afford to continue working on NXT as some future arbitrary decision is prone to just totally break everything they worked on.<br /><br />&quot;This would require storing the ask/bid orders on the fNXT chain as non-prunable transactions&quot; This is the easy way to implement the required function. But you refuse to be open to doing it since to put the bids/asks on the prunable NXT chain and just the actual trades on the fNXT chain would require more work. Please do not tell me it cannot be done that way. You can admit that you are not able to do it that way, but I would imagine that it is possible to put the aggregated trades from the bid/asks that filled for each time period into a provable summary transaction which goes into the fNXT chain.<br /><br />So now we know that the whole thread about community feedback is a farce and that you are making technical decisions based on what is easy to do and not willing to compromise at all, you will create the precedence that there will be hardforks made to benefit only the existing NXT holders and that anything built on top of NXT will not only not be protected, they are liable to have some of their value transferred to NXT.<br /><br />I know this is your house, and I am unwelcome and you dont like &quot;unclean&quot; things that solve practical problems and prefer code purity over all else. And with code purity as the dominant priority, it is not a surprise that little insignificant things like protecting the interest of millions of dollars invested in the AE are not worth spending much effort on.<br /><br />So I will try my best to not be here and let you do your thing. I will be making a way for people to have the choice to transfer assets atomically cross chain to other blockchains. To chains where asset investors rights are protected and not subject to arbitrary decisions by the devs ratified by the NXT holders who directly benefit. When the right to decide which hardfork to use in the hands of the people that benefit from it and the parties that are damaged have no voice at all, it should come as no surprise to you that these parties do not feel like staying.<br /><br />I apologize for having contaminated your blockchain with so many AE transactions that you have to prune away.<br /><br />James

					On Feb 2nd I made a release of iguana InstantDEX that supports nxtae as one of the &quot;exchanges&quot;<br /><br />I had asked to get some help from the community to help with testing it. After almost 2.5 weeks the total amount of testing by the NXT community: 0<br /><br />I saw some posts where I was somehow being unrealistic to expect any help from the NXT community after what I did. I guess my trying to stop BC2 at a personal loss of marketcap of over a million USD makes me a really evil person. I knew there would be some backlash and I debated if I should just stay silent, but I did not feel it was right to ignore an arbitrary decision that was made that would hurt NXT.<br /><br />There are many new comers here without any background to know who I am and must think that I must be some sort of ego maniac. I apologize for my dramatic entry, but my assessment was this is the last chance to stop a fatal mistake. Dont get me wrong it wont be overnight and NXT price should do just fine, in fact it should go up by the delta amount, whatever that amount is.<br /><br />For the longest of time I had more value in my assets than all others combined. I actually know assets pretty well, so dont be convinced by the people who say there is no problem. There is a big problem as I have written and I am not smart enough to be able to figure out any solutions as impossible constraints have already been decided on.<br /><br />And since there is a total lack of support for helping with the testing of NXT, please do not complain about how long it is taking. I will get it done, but without anybody testing it, it will get to the bottom of the list as I prioritize specific issues that the testers are finding and if there are no testers I wont get to it until I am done with the other parts.<br /><br />Now I know I am having no power other than my words, so I did word things a bit stronger than normal, but I still speak the truth. With the current structure NXT is at the mercy of tech decisions made in a vacuum that usually is pretty good, sometimes brilliant, but occasionally disastrous. I try to stay out of the way and step in only when I see a disaster in the making.<br /><br />Good luck and I hope this wont end up like BC2, but if anybody wants to sell SuperNET assets below NAV let me know<br /><br />James

Does that mean if you dont mean to hurt someone, but you do that its ok?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">By design, these Assets have no influence within Nxt itself, for several very good reasons....<br />...but the AE and asset holders <em>are</em> an important part of the Nxt eco-system and community, that's undeniable.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>it is by design that assets have no influence but they are important. OK I agree, but what prevents the NXT forgers from adopting fNXT? and gNXT and hNXT...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><strong>Here's a scenario to consider :</strong><br />Current Nxt keeps on rolling (with some improvements, like a saner MS interface,or even another client) while JLP develops Nxt2.0.<br />That's gonna be at least a year, probably more like 18 months. In that time there will be no major changes in core Nxt 1.7 functionality or API.<br /><br />When Nxt2.0 is ready to rock.....figure out a distribution system for the fNXT (and maybe NXT2.0 for the first childchain) and kick the blockchain off, with no connection to the current Nxt 1.7 blockchain at all, (except for fNXT/NXT2.0 distribution)<br />If projects/users want to migrate....they can, or they can remain on the Nxt 1.7 fork...or on both.<br />Yeah, having 2 completely seperate NXT blockchains running simultaneously might be tricky, but it is certainly decentralised. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /><br /><br />(and I doubt that the 2 blockchains will remain seperate for long, projects will spring up to bridge the gaps between 1.7 and 2.0, and the 2 should obviously share as much API compatibilty as is possible)<br /><br /><br />Think about it, sweet dreams.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So a new NXT without any connection to the current NXT, which means NXT being used as the reference currency basically gets frozen with the current feature set and all the new tech into fNXT, which is what I predicted would happen.<br /><br />My assessment is that this is the best plan so far that involves splitting NXT, but you realize you are proposing that existing assets wont get any new tech unless they go to the new chain where they will be at the mercy of the forgers.<br /><br />So contrary to your statement that AE is important it isnt important enough to allow for 1GB/year increase in the size of the blockchain. You will protect the assets from the one two punch of deflation event and 1873, but the choice is to get stranded on 1.7 tech forever as clearly all the rest of the technologytree will be on the new 2.0 codebase. <br /><br />It seems I am talking in circles. I hope I made myself clear. If a hardfork means that asset issuers will have to suffer through a self-inflicted deflation event and recovery or left behind and not linked to the main currency, it will show the same disregard that third party developers were shown by BC2<br /><br />That is my feedback. Any plan that doesnt protect the assets is DOA for the asset issuers and investors and migration plans will need to be started. Just like the forgers by design have the power to vote for blocks and hardforks, asset issuers have the power to move to a different blockchain.<br /><br />I am sad that I have to be so blunt and probably people will spin this to make it my fault that fNXT will split NXT. At this point I await a decision from the community if it wants the SuperNET and my other assets to remain with NXT or if like BC2 you feel NXT doesnt need the bother to deal with such a demanding person.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. For investors in my assets you might have missed it but the logic is simple, either NXT will take actions to protect your interests or I will. Either way your investments in assets I control will be protected. Current plan would be to have a way to transfer to the BTC/BTCD chains where BTCD is used for the one minute blocktime things and BTC for archival coldstorage. That way you can benefit from the security of BTC, but have the one minute speed. However if you want to remain on the NXT blockchain and take your chances, that will be supported to. You will be able to choose which blockchain to reside on. If there are enough arbitrageurs (no guarantee of this) then it will provide decent protection from deflation events due to the automatic liquidity that would flow in.

So nothing prevents the large stakes to vote for their self-interest. After all that is what they are supposed to do! If a company didnt vote their self interest then people would lose their jobs.<br /><br />So combine this shark behavior (which is expected and encouraged) with a development process that is closed and where feedback is ignored. So what prevents the NXT holders from voting for value transfer from other classes of the ecosystem?<br /><br />With block security, the difficulty of the scattered forgers to coordinate is a barrier and arguable BTC is more centralized in this area. Plus who cares about a few thousand NXT if you have millions. However, if there is a new hardfork, ZERO coordination is needed. ALL NXT holders will vote their economic interest automatically. And they cant be blamed for it.<br /><br />The temptation is too great, especially if we are talking about significant amounts.<br /><br />Basically the NXT community must solve this issue and convince the nonvoting AE community that they wont be abused.<br /><br />James

First, I have a name idea for this chain instead of &quot;fNXT&quot; we could call it &quot;meta&quot; as it contains information about the child chain but is not the childchain itself. It is &quot;beyond&quot; the childChains so I think the name META fits pretty well for this.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Metadata is &quot;data that provides information about other data</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Like this name 'Meta'&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cool.gif" alt="8&#41;" title="Cool" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Your 're-distribution of the forging power' idea, not so much.&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Short NXT anyone?&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br />I'm flip flopping but feeling it again for this NXT 2.0 plan to split it up. <br /><br />Giving fNXT the name META gives me 2 coins instead of 1, each different strength, each ready to focus. <br /><br />I feel having invested in NXT may finally get me some sweet juice.&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cool.gif" alt="8&#41;" title="Cool" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It is certainly in the economic interest of NXT holders without assets to really like this plan. After all if asset holders are losing value, it must be going somewhere.<br /><br />However a lot of the value of NXT today is from the AE and for a value transfer from the AE that created a lot of value to the passive (but important!) NXT holders, will cause a loss of are large part of AE activity, which might or might not compensate for the gain.<br /><br />The problem is that nobody can truthfully quantify the delta effect and this is one step forward two steps back situation where we are dealing not with just adding value but subtracting.<br /><br />What on earth justifies this mistreatment of asset peoples? I guess profit motive and asset people deserve what happens as they shouldnt have relied on community to not vote to restructure the coin the assets were issued on.<br /><br />But money is money and the big NXT holders will certainly vote for the value transfer that is in their favor. But also the asset issuers will vote the only way they can. With their feet<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Back when you said that NXT alone will outperform assets I did not take into account the possibility that the reference currency would be devalued. So I admit you were right, since holding NXT allows to vote for restructuring the coin in whatever way will transfer value from the non-voters to the voters. It is impossible for assets to outperform the NXT (and its spawned fNXT, gNXT, hNXT,...).

So manipulative, it reeks. It's up to the readers to make conclusions.<br /><br />The value of fNXT is locked up in forging accounts and has no relation to assets, now or after the NXT 2.0 fork. Please try to understand it, I am sure you do. This 400 million forging coins have no interest to trade assets, now or after the NXT 2.0 fork. It's like they don't exist for the asset market, doesn't matter if they are detached from the total supply or not, they don't participate in trading, they forge and are locked up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The more fNXT is worth the bigger delta is, the bigger the problem is. Can we agree with that? The assumption is the 2.0 as proposed as I have no indication that your swapping back and forth would be allowed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not suggesting swapping back and forth. The supply of fNXT will be fixed at the hard fork by burning NXT with no more fNXT ever allowed to be created. The total supply will be 1 billion (assuming 60/40 ratio, 600m+400m). fNXT can be traded for NXT, same as it can be traded for BTC, USD or cowrie shells, but no swapping.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well a one time swap reminds me of russian roullete, but with all but one chambers having a bullet. If the wrong amount of NXT is burned, then your rebalancing wont work and depending on the margin of error that can be absorbed (unknowable) all others would cause imbalances.<br /><br />less than current prosal so it is an improvement and if we magically figure out the value of delta ahead of time, then maybe all will be well for this aspect.<br /><br />If the absorbable tolerance is +/-5%, then there are 20 possible values,lets toss out half of them, so we would have a 10% chance of being right and preventing a liquidity crunch.<br /><br />What happens if fNXT value in the future changes? The 1 in 10 chance works only to prevent the hardfork liquidity problem (which is quite an achievement I have to congratulate you on that), but it is 90% of varying levels of bad.<br /><br />And it assumes and unchanging and static ratio of value. But progress!<br /><br />James

I never said this and I never will. Undoubtedly AE is an important part of the ecosystem. What I did say up thread is that market corrections are healthy to purge bubbly assets, and I also said a few pages ago that deflation of asset prices is <em>inevitable</em> for at least three reasons, regardless of the NXT 2.0 plans.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sorry&nbsp; I didnt quote you specifically and I used some logic:<br /><a href="https://nxtforum.org/core-development-discussion/nxt-2-0-design/msg210311/#msg210311" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/index.php?topic=10828.msg210311#msg210311</a><br />&quot;The true voting is done by forging, it&#039;s all that matters.&quot;<br /><br />You do agree that you said this right.<br />So logically if forging is all that matters, nothing else matters, right?<br />Is that too much distortion of the truth by me?<br /><br />And if assets are not NXT, they cant forge right? <br />So combining these separate but true parts we can transform your statement to have logical equivalence to saying that since asset holders cant forge they dont matter at all.<br /><br />I am done with you trying to paint me as misrepresenting and manipulating. Short of a retraction and apology it is not worth my time debating with someone that makes such outlandish claims about my honor and then doesnt admit it was a mistake.<br /><br />So it was either a mistake and your forgot what you wrote, so you apologize or you are intentionally misrepresenting what I say and I have no time for that<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We were talking about voting. I said forging is all that matters. Implying it's all that matters for ultimate consensus of the blockchain at the hard fork block, to counter argument your claim than NXT is centralized and everybody dances to JL's tune. You can interpret my words any way you want, of course, it's your right and nobody can take it from you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I will take this as an apology and in turn I will apologize for misinterpreting what you said.<br /><br />So you deny that NXT development is centralized? That there is no open github, but rather closed until a release. I claim that the more closed the development process is the closer to centralized it is as who else can even do anything until it is released.<br /><br />Not saying that it is sufficient to have a fully open process as even then it can be quite controlled by rejecting all contributions. But with a closed development process that releases source at release points, it is very centralized to the inside developers.<br /><br />Are you a coder by any chance? Maybe a software project manager? Or will you just hypothesize some abstract concept to say that closed enables higher quality so its not centralized as the result will be coherent and perfect.<br /><br />And I take it you do not deny that assetholders have no forging power and therefore cannot vote on the hardfork.<br /><br />So basically I am correct in all my points, just misunderstood why you were objecting<br /><br />James

Total dollar market cap hasn't changed and is $10 million, we have two markets instead of one, the dollar value market cap of fNXT + NXT 2.0 = dollar value market cap of NXT 1.x. The same 600 million NXT 2.0 go after assets that 600 million of NXT 1.x used to do.

I said this was better from the standpoint that the repricing is done with the relative amounts of NXT/fNXT and the corresponding market caps.<br /><br />So it is a much cleaner way for the repricing. The problem is that it is nonviable at 100fNXT cost per trade of NXT &lt;-&gt; fNXT. It also allows for potentially dramatic swings in ratios and could make things much worse or really weaken network security.<br /><br />But it solves the need to reprice by assuming we can rebalance the relative supply to determine the relative values and as long as the relative extremes are not happening, it might even work.<br /><br />However what mechanism is there to prevent the NXT from going below the required amount to not create a liquidity crunch? or to prevent fNXT from going below the required level for adequate security?<br /><br />And even if these things are dampend or capped, we now end up in a situation where everything is riding on top of a bouncing ball that is oscillating. And I have a feeling that it wont be so stable<br /><br />But considering the alternative, I guess it is better, but it adds a whole new set of variables on an already complicated system, so not sure if it can be analyzed that well ahead of time.<br /><br />James

Which doesnt sound so bad, but prior to that it was both gold and silver that were basically the currency status. So we have two halves that are together before the 1873 and afterwards only the gold, with silver having to stand alone on its noncurrency uses. <br /><br />so current NXT is modeled by pre 1873 (gold + silver) (fNXT + NXT)<br />after 1873 gold/fNXT and silver/NXT2.0<br /><br />Silver price crashed, and anything denominated in silver suffered. Most of you probably dont remember things back in 1873, but it was pretty grim, only the great depression of the 1930&#039;s was worse.<br /><br />Splitting a currency and demoting part of it to non-currency status will devalue that part. It is logical, I have math and historical support.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />NXT going to NXT 2.0 is the post-1873 world modeled in NXT as gold with the money function and fNXT as silver with a special utility function.<br /><br /><em><strong>Silver price crashed after the 1873 reform because utility functions of silver were not largely discovered until the age of electronics.</strong> The world has depleted billions of ounces of silver since the Hunt brothers cornered the silver market, at present time the above ground supply of silver is less than the above ground supply of gold. The price of silver in the last 30 years is suppressed with paper derivatives but that's another story, hope it doesn't come to trading derivatives of fNXT or the system is in real trouble. Actually it doesn't matter if derivatives for fNXT are invented, the fees paid in fNXT will take care of delivery of fNXT from exchanges to the forging accounts, so that's not a big issue.</em><br /><br />In other words, you have historical evidence unrelated to the issue under discussion, please try again.<br /><br />fNXT has a huge utility function, there is no reason to believe it's price will crash. The wise fee structure is the problem that a lot of thought needs to be given. It should be as free market as possible.<br /><br />The historical ratio of 40/60 can be relied on for calculations of fNXT/NXT ratio. The same 600 million coins valued at $6 million will go after the assets, the same 400 million coins valued at $4 million will forge, give or take a few percentage points. No dramatic movements I don't see here to occur.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You are either intentionally misinterpreting my analogy or somehow not comprehending. The fNXT price is not the issue. It is the fact that it has value, which is currently part of NXT. Why is this so difficult? Are you some paid troll?<br /><br />the historical ratio of forging is irrelevant for the most part. The most important thing is that fNXT has value, it is being subtracted from NXT, thus making NXT value less than it was and assets are denominated in NXT.<br /><br />historically when the reference currency is devalued (recent BTC bear market hurt alts and the NXT drop hur assets) the things that use it as a reference drop in value. Maybe this is what you are debating? that it doesnt matter the price of BTC for alts? If so, there isnt much point in continuing this discussion as you are clearly smart enough to understand that and it would become clear to everyone that you are just trolling.<br /><br />So given that you believe subtraction of a positive number reduces the value of something and that BTC price affects alts (value of reference currency matters) we are left with the conclusion without any math, just relative comparisons that assets trading against NXT after the fNXT split will be hurt.<br /><br />To quantify this I dug up the 1873 example of a previously combined pair (gold/silver) and what happened when one of them lost its status as money. How you try to make it look like an inappropriate analogy with events from 100 years later really stretches your credibility and moves me closer to the ignore button for you as that is what i do to smart trolls with an agenda who twists facts around.<br /><br />fNXT will have value proportional to the value from childchains and existing forging. we dont know how much this is but it is likely significant, possibly the majority value of the current combined NXT.<br /><br />The bigger the value of fNXT the bigger the impact on assets. Based on the match and relative values described above. and before you reply that NXT has all these great features and will retain its current value, you might want to analyse the effect on market price when something goes from exclusive to nonexclusive. Like when some medicine goes from patented to public domain.<br /><br />Since the value of childchains flows directly to fNXT and bypasses NXT, NXT does not benefit from childchains. fNXT does. The forging percentage does not matter for the long term effect of changing the reference currency. <br /><br />I wont respond to your posts unless they are based on facts and dont misrepresent things. If you are going to respond, please address my specific points about about subtraction and reference currency. Once we can agree that subtraction subtracts and that the value of the reference currency impacts the things that refer to it, then we can move to the non-exclusivity aspect<br /><br />James

I understand the hurt ego from your interaction with JL, but seriously, it's not productive to be so manipulative.<br /><br />So you haven't seen math. The only math you can calculate comes from the 40/60 ratio, and a year to adjust for asset investment miscalculations. You have given no math (you think you did but you didn't) to back your claims. In other words, it's all up in the air and nothing's decided. It'll help seeing this design in code in the test net and then discuss more. It's months away, one day is a long time in crypto.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the math NXT will be worth (1 - delta) of what it is now with delta being unknowable but likely in the range of 10% to 70%.<br /><br />I do not see how the prices can adjust ahead of time when the split happens at a specific time. people have to bid in combined NXT, not split off NXT<br /><br />There is no need to see the tech to know that fNXT has value. Do you deny that? We dont know what the value is. that is why i use &quot;delta&quot;<br /><br />I can dig up where it was flatly stated that fNXT transactions will cost 100fNXT in the same way it has been stated that NXT must be pruned, and in the same way 160 bytes is the arbitrary number used instead of 256 which would have made things much easier. ZERO accomodation to feedback in the vast majority of areas, regardless of how important.<br /><br />The fact that there is no way to determine delta ahead of time is another reason why it is bad. How exactly is the market supposed to reprice ahead of time against a delta factor that nobody will know using the combined NXT?<br /><br />Let me give and example since you claim I havent, even though I did.<br /><br />to avoid debating over the unknowable for this example we assume delta is 0.5<br />meaning 50% value for NXT and 50% value for fNXT. The good thing about this is that it cant be more than 49% wrong.<br /><br />With me so far?<br /><br />OK so we have a NAV backed asset to remove any value from anything that is not solid. that is a separate issue.<br /><br />This asset is priced at 50, but with the above assumptions it is worth 100 NXT2.0<br /><br />We are before the hardfork, with months and months to go. Please explain what bid I should put in for this asset to preadjust the price? I am not smart enough to figure it out. To my thinking I only have the combined NXT so I cant do this repricing. The idea of issuing a fNXT asset ahead of time to let the market decide the price is actually not bad as it allows to get an idea of what delta is and all you have to do is create an trading triplet where you price the asset in terms of asset/NXT -&gt; asset/NXT2.0<br /><br />ooops, we dont have a NXT2.0 asset, we have an fNXT asset<br />so using the fNXT + NXT2.0 = NXT asset, we derive:<br /><br />NXT2.0 = (NXT - fNXT)<br />which means we just need to reprice the asset to be asset/(NXT - fNXT) which is asset/NXT - asset/fNXT<br /><br />now we can do asset/NXT that is what is there now and since asset/asset is only available via Quack, we need to setup trades with someone else to do the asset/fNXT pricing and we need to do both halves of this at the same time to achieve a repricing.<br /><br />Sounds really simple and easy for everyone to do. I am sure they are all off writing their own tradebots to do this arbitrage and we will have really exactly repricings in place way ahead of time.<br /><br />or<br /><br />99% of people's head explodes trying to figure out how to rebalance ahead of time with the available features and just wait for the hard fork.<br /><br />Which do you feel is more likely? Or is there some other way to rebalance ahead of time? And if it cant be rebalanced ahead of time, just the hardfork event appears to be enough of a risk to not do this. and this assumes an fNXT asset will be issued<br /><br />James

There is no obligation for forgers to fork to JL's new design. They can stay in NXT 1.x and be happy. If this is not consensus and decentralization, show me the truly decentralized system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>crypto relies on gametheory math to work<br /><br />NXT forgers will rationally choose to go to 2.0 fork as they get a windfall fNXT distribution. The asset issuers have not ability to choose to stay on 1.x as there wont be enough stake to keep the network secure, not to mention no dev team.<br /><br />We might as well move to NAS. <br /><br />The centralization in NXT is the usual dev centralization that all coins have to some extent, especially the smaller ones. But a major coin like NXT should not be at the mercy of any single person and provisions to listen to the community needs to be in place unless the community is not important.<br /><br />Where is the commitment to adhere to voting results by the dev team?<br /><br />Even that is not there and I guess there is no reason it has to be, but without it asset issuers will have to decide if they can trust the decisions that will be made that affect them wont harm them enough?!?!? Really? You find this an acceptable thing?<br /><br />Dont you realize that if fNXT goes through there will be a mass exodus of issuers to other platforms? Most decisions would be based on an intuitive loss of trust that such a big change is just forced onto people and then fanboys cheering it on for the expected pump.<br /><br />Really, is that what NXT is now?<br /><br />Now even if there is a commitment by the devs to follow voting results, the past history of ignoring them and breaking the promises (BC1) does not bode well.<br /><br />I was told that I was the most influential person in NXT. The scary thing is that it was probably true. And I have ZERO influence on topics that have been decided already. Even if the change is a matter of changing one number from 160 to 256 and that would save two months worth of work. Of course no way that the API behavior can be changed to prevent breaking any installation in the field, that was already working. <br /><br />I had no influence. believe me I tried at great personal cost.<br /><br />Also, what protections do AE people have of not being expropriated in the future if the NXT holders feel it is in their best interests? This whole &quot;feedback&quot; thread is full of &quot;no&quot;, &quot;not an issue&quot;, &quot;cant be done&quot;, etc. etc<br /><br />Why is it already decided before any community feedback that NXT must be split? [technically i dont care if it is implemented as a childchain, I talk of the money aspect]<br /><br />Why is it already decided that it will cost 100 fNXT per transaction?<br /><br />Why is basically anything that isnt a fanboy post rejected?<br /><br />So after weeks of this community &quot;feedback&quot; it will be to announce that the community had a chance to voice its opinions and the decision is made to keep the 2.0 exactly as it was.<br /><br />I call this the ten commandments approach to listening to feedback. If the feedback matches what is on the tablets, its great feedback. If it goes against it, then it is not possible. However, if it is in a part of the tablet that are still not chiseled, then ok we can put in the community number.<br /><br />this level of community responsiveness is just not enough and certainly does not make me feel like my interests and my asset investor's interests will be of any concern. Maybe I have no right to expect to be listened to since I sold off all my NXT. Oh, but I didnt. SuperNET still has the vast majority of NXT so this whole fNXT thing wont hurt SuperNET directly. But I expect there will be the FUD attack that I just want special treatment, I have a giant ego, etc.<br /><br />I am just trying to save NXT from the biggest mistake it can make at this point. If technically childchains cant be done in java to special case protect NXT and assets, then just make private chains and charge some sort of fee for it and distribute it as dividends to the forgers and leave NXT as the bloated 1GB/year chain it is now. <br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I could have made a windfall but not posting today, waiting for the asset dumps. this is opposite to the financial effect which should be to increase to compensate for delta to match the value, not decrease it, I would have made a lot of money. Maybe I could have gotten 2 SuperNET for 1 Rimbit.

I told my analysis had a detail to be clarified and it is close to what you wrote. The effect of the delta can be adjusted by the velocity of the asset trading. I dont have any recent stats on how much NXT is tied up in bids for assets, but certainly it isnt 100% of the assetcap.<br /><br />And your method would roughly balance the value according to market forces and over time, it might not be so bad. Except for the first days where there will be massive market movements, which most assets should recover from in time. However, since the NXT holders are the ones that have the option to burn for fNXT, then it becomes possible that they make decisions without any consideration to the asset holders.<br /><br />So it could be possible to end up with 80% fNXT and 20% NXT, which would be a problem big enough to affect the external markets. Or maybe it is 20/80 the other way, in which case we end up with no network security.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You make huge assumptions. We have seen the forging stake stable at 40%, the rest of the stake has no desire to forge. Can you list reasons why this should change with the NXT 2.0 design implementations?<br /><br />There are no <em>first days of market movements.</em> From my understanding the proposed design can go live no sooner than a year from today. It's a long time for gradual asset price adjustments. Where do disruptive massive market movements come from in your view? Users have a year to make plans to enter or exit assets. Most importantly there is no reason to expect the forging stake ratio to change. There is historical data it's at 40/60. You guesses of 20/80, 80/20 have no grounds whatsoever.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">And still the silver deflation effect is not solved, though its negative effect is lessened a bit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is not related to the proposed NXT 2.0 design, but is legacy of the fixed supply decision. Maybe NXT should allow for 1% yearly inflation into the system?<br /><br />Truth is asset prices will deflate regardless of NXT 1.x or going to NXT 2.0 design. Reasons are few but important. a) Investors lose patience and sell. b) Price of NXT goes up and investors sell to cash out. c) More assets are created chased by the same 600 million of traded coins, old assets are sold to buy into new assets du jour.<br /><br />Going to NXT 2.0 design the system gets scalability.<br />Staying in NXT 1.x the system gets ossified and out-competed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Did you read the link about 1873? it is really quite relevant.<br />The problem for the devaluation is that it happens in one moment and starting that moment the adjustment can begin. People cant reprice assets in terms of the NXT2.0 before the hardfork since if they do, they are spending NXT+fNXT when they should have only spend NXT, which they cant do.<br /><br />So even smart intelligent people assisted by automated tradebots wont be able to adjust the prices until the block of the hard fork. After that, either there will be a few who capitalize on the low hanging fruit and make a one time windfall (at the expense of anybody not able to code their own tradebots) and this windfall comes from the vast majority of the people. <br /><br />If you do not understand that the hardfork event is &quot;only&quot; a onetime event. As it is currently it is a major major event. With your improvement it is still better, but due to the unknowable value of the delta, there will be few who do the transition correctly and an important point is that if you dont do anything, you could well lose out. Maybe if you just cancelled all your AE bid/asks till the dust settles it would be reasonably safe. Not sure.<br /><br />The permanent problem of demoting assets from being backed by gold to being backed by a token that is backed by gold. Ignoring any security issues this might have, it is very close to what happened to silver in 1873. It took almost 8 years for things to normalize. and it never got back to where it used to be since silver did not have any value as money anymore.<br /><br />this is not about distribution, it is about what assets are denominated in. The reference for assets is being devalued and this is permanent. Worse is that as a part of this devaluation it is now at risk of being pruned, but the point of excess problems is exceeded way before the pruning issue or even the potential security issues.<br /><br />Who cares about potential security issues where you would lose some money when you are sure to lose it in the first place.<br /><br />I still do not see any math that proves that changing assets to be based on something that is less than the current NXT doesnt hurt it. Nor have I seen any benefit to NXT from the childchains. Nor have I seen how NXT is supposed to retain its value as non-exclusive user of the feature set and subject to the identical conditions as childchains.<br /><br />Dont you understand this is like kicking someone out of your house and treating them exactly the same as any stranger? And no special treatment of any sort and this is what is being done to the NXT that assets use as a reference. Make fNXT and NXT the same and the problem goes away and we get all the benefits of childchains at the cost of ~1GB of bloat per year. If asset issuances for new assets after the hardfork is only for the childchains, that would give some scarcity value to existing assets. <br /><br />Apparently it is impossible to implement pruning and childchains without making NXT a childchain too. And the price for fNXT transaction is already carved in the stone tablets at 100fNXT, so that cant be changed either. Considering that all this is just a discussion about possibilities and nothing is decided, there sure are quite a few things that have been decided.<br /><br />If there is no leeway about these things then why am I wasting time debating it?<br /><br />James

That is the idea.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So a 100x fee increase is just fine? Already prices were increased by fiat declaration 10x for permanent storage and we were forced to spend almost 2 months to reduce MGW to below 160 bytes, since the arbitrary limit was set to 160 and MGW was using about 180 bytes.<br /><br />Now it turns out all that work was meaningless as NXT is to become prunable.<br /><br />BTC 0.12 about to release implements pruning. So having the pruning feature is not very powerful. To damage AE for the sake of pruning is nonsensical.<br /><br />to increase prices 100x is unwise.<br /><br />James
