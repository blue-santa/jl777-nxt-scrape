The list could even be auto updated every day.&nbsp; JLP original idea of &quot;featured&quot; list wasn't bad, but some people complained about decentralization. <br /><br />How would we make sure the third party &quot;sources&quot; that compile such lists could be linked from dclient -- yet keeping the client decentralized?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>By defaulting to no third party list, but allowing the user select from a list of community approved list providers. We can put a BIG warning that usage of the third party lists voids the decentralization guarantee and they are relying on a potentially evil list provider<br /><br />This concept of decentralization at all costs needs to be compromised with not gutting the usability of the AE<br /><br />We can have our decentralization and still make the AE useful.<br /><br />jean-luc exercises sole control over the NRS releases. That is pretty centralized, but without that the release process would become chaotic and so we accept this non-decentralized aspect of NXT<br /><br />AE assets are what differentiates NXT from clones.<br />This is an important point, so I will repeat it.<br />AE assets are what differentiates NXT from clones.<br /><br />We just need a community approved process for list providers URL to be included to a selection dialogue. The fact that any list provider that follows a reasonable set of community standards is alone somewhat decentralized. When in doubt, allow the list maker on the dialogue. Maybe there will be dozens of list providers, but so be it. This is&nbsp; a selection that just has to be done once.<br /><br />The important thing is to not give preference to any list provider. Randomize the order if it doesnt fit in a scroll box if that is so important.<br /><br />Please tell me what about the above is so non-decentralized that we cannot do it?<br /><br />James

Financial products that invest in virtual money is on a list of financial products that may no longer be sold to individuals . Since 1 July The FSMA denotes hazards with virtual currencies , such as the risk that the trading platform is hacked , the exchange rate risk and the absence of a legal guarantee that the virtual money is exchanged for its value oorspornkelijke </em>&quot;<br /><br />But as well as a reedit user says:<br /><br />&quot;<em>It explicitly mentions derivatives on virtual money (like bitcoin.)<br />So again, derivatives. Not bitcoin itself. So we're talking about futures, swaps, options, forward, credit default swaps etc.<br />Almost nobody is doing this at the moment worldwide, and probably nobody in Belgium. So it doesn't have any effect at the moment. It doesn't at all talk about banning the purchase of virtual money itself, just derivatives.<br />It does mean that hedging contracts to remove exchange-rate risk for individuals isn't possible in Belgium.<br /><span class="bbc_u">It's a ban on commercialising such products to non-professional parties. So citizens. That means companies can still buy and sell derivatives on bitcoin.<br />That's it. Not a big deal, right now it looks like FUD but it's not.</span></em>[/u]<br /><br /><a href="http://dcmagnates.com/belgium-regulator-fsma-issues-ban-of-virtual-currency-based-derivatives-effective-july-1/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://dcmagnates.com/belgium-regulator-fsma-issues-ban-of-virtual-currency-based-derivatives-effective-july-1/</a><br /><br /><hr /><hr /><br /><em>We continue looking for people from USA and ASIA to join us.

For example, a belgian citizen on his own accord finds and buys shortNXT, has Belgian law been violated?<br /><br />Is the belgian citizen in trouble?<br />or is shortNXT in trouble?<br /><br />if the latter, how does Belgium plan on enforcing this law? Will they extradite shortNXT to brussels? Will they ban all of NXT because there is an illegal derivative available that might be purchased by a belgian?<br /><br />James

Ideally, the GUI on initial use would have a list of Asset filter URLs with proper explanations so it is just a single additional click on install. Default would be to not have any Asset filter URL, so if they are the type to not pay attention then they dont see any assets<br /><br />Hope that will make everybody happy<br /><br />James

					Ever wanted to get 1% of a promising new coin for free AFTER it starts trading and proves its popularity?<br /><br />This shark did with MRO <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Well not exactly for free, but when i saw the mania building, I accumulated 1%, but it cost 40 btc or so. Thats not free, but that&#039;s just the beginning. Having seen the mania pattern enough times, it was clear MRO was going to go up fast and come down fast, then bounce around, consolidate and gradually rise or decay to nothing. The problem is when to jump off, have to keep a really close eye on the price movement! Better a bit too early than a bit too late.<br /><br />So, I was waiting for the right moment and if you look at <a href="https://www.poloniex.com/exchange/btc_mro" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.poloniex.com/exchange/btc_mro</a> right before 11:45 on the chart you will see a big drop. selling 1% quickly does that. Now I could have probably gotten more, but I had banked ~20BTC of profits (turned out it was a bit less, so thats a little mistake) and when MRO reached half of DRK it was just way too expensive. I knew that by taking less and dropping the price so rapidly, it would really mess up the moving average charts. This I knew would signal all the technical traders to change from accumulate to sell. There was a little bounce, but on low volume.<br /><br />At that point I was pretty convinced that the price will slowly decay and so I setup a whole slew of buys at lower and lower prices so that if it ever dropped to the price it was trading at before the pump, I would end up with 1%. Total cost ~20BTC! So far 0.75% of MRO accumulated so now the shark has a nice bite of an interesting new crypto with very little exposure. Will MRO ever get back to where it was? I have no idea. If it gets a user base it has a chance of surviving and growing, but it is such an early coin doesnt even have a wallet yet. So its reaching half a DRK so soon was clearly a mania. Now all the MRO money seems to have gone into DRK. I didnt think that obvious development through, so my swapping DRK for NXT at 175 to 1 was another small mistake<br /><br />My style is to take a smaller gain to lock in profits than to try to make each trade double or triple. Ride the trend and as soon as it looks like it is weaking, jump off. You make about half of what you could, but you eliminate 90% of the risk. A bunch of small gains adds up to nice long term growth. At least that is my short term strategy. If I can get 1% of a promising coin for &quot;free&quot; then it could end up being silly like DUCK (I did manage to bail with a small profit) or a homerun like DRK. For NXT, I had to work insane hours for 6 months, but it has been well worth it!<br /><br />Now that the market is digesting the arrival of DRK to the major leagues and BTC reversing the downtrend, not sure when the shark will bite next. I did warn the poloniex trollbox MRO was headed for a fall. They just called me a troll.<br /><br />With DRK above the 200:1 ratio against NXT, it seems clear that anytime it goes below 100 is a good time to accumulate DRK.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. If I am personally responsible for ending the MRO mania, well I did warn about investing in any crypto other than NXT

					Finally, now that AE launch is a week behind us, I able to finish all the nontech work with more than a few hours left in the day!<br /><br />That means I can actually write code again. <br /><br />So back to the MGW issue that I have to put silly pauses before each RPC command to reduce the number of 10 seconds sleeps that seems to be the only way to get things working again. OK this doesnt sound that bad until you count the number of RPC calls are needed to rescan the BTC blockchain. Ever wonder why reprocessing the blockchain takes so long?<br /><br />The reason is that it does not seem to be optimized at all. They assumed that the network will be the bottleneck and did not count on tens of thousands of requests per second that my code issues. I use hashtables that have on average two iterations regardless of table entries so it is effectively constant time searching. Basically everything is really fast, except for the libcurl.<br /><br />Each BTC block has a lot of transactions, so reprocessing requires 1 RPC to get the block and N*2 RPC for each tx in the block since I have to getrawtx and decode it. bitcoind does not properly associate multisig addrs to accts. It really has been a challenge to make MGW work properly<br /><br />Anyway the practical problem was that each time I made a new version I had to wait for 30+ minutes to reprocess. To me that is a LONG time. So I check PM's, catchup on forum and next thing you know I am far away from debugging. By the time I notice that it has finally reprocessed I usually cant remember what change I just made.<br /><br />Something had to be done. I like interactive debugging. Make a small change, verify it works, repeat until all bugs are fixed. I make hundreds of test versions per day when actively debugging.<br /><br />Anyway, I was considering gutting the current control flow to deal with this issue, but I just couldnt get myself to do it. Afterall, it is 99% working and any new implementation has no guarantee of being that much better. But to speed it up requires a massive overall. Or does it?<br /><br />Dont know why I didnt think of it before, lack of sleep and time is what I blame <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />Good news is that I am current waiting for the test of the sped up version. Still not great, but instead of 30+ minutes, less than 5 minutes to reprocess!<br /><br />So, I can finally semi-interactively debug MGW<br /><br />James

A peer-to-peer exchange could be as hard to police for the money cartels as bittorrent has been for the copyright cartels. <br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />&quot;In recent months, there has been no shortage of potentially alarming headlines detailing how mainstream financial and tech giants such as eBay, IBM and JPMorgan may be looking to enter or impact the bitcoin space with strategic patent filings.<br /><br />The most recent company to enter these ranks was Colorado-based remittance giant Western Union, which received a patent on 1st April that reports have suggested would give the company a claim to a key aspect of the bitcoin industry – the exchange of alternative currencies.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Even if it was a global patent (its not) this is not an issue at all, from article:<br /><br />“This patent only grants Western Union the right to stop someone from using the ‘assessor’ functionality for 20 years, not the right to exclude people from using exchanges to trade money. If your exchange does not have an ‘assessor’, it does not apply to you.”<br />

So NXTers pin their hopes on &quot;forging&quot; instead of &quot;mining&quot;.&nbsp; But in its own way forging is as much of a sham as mining.&nbsp; &nbsp;The hue and cry is that &quot;the rich NXT holders get the lion's share of the fees&quot;.&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; NXT is a proof-of-stake coin, they are supposed to, that's how this toy works.&nbsp; But whining about the rich getting the most forged fees is&nbsp; stating the situation with the wrong emphasis.&nbsp; EVERYBODY IN NXT GETS THEIR FAIR SHARE OF FORGED COINS AND THAT PERCENTAGE SHARE IS EQUAL FOR EVERYBODY.<br /><br />BECAUSE EVERYBODY GETS AN EQUAL PERCENTAGE SHARE OF FORGED COINS, there is no wealth to be had in NXT forging.&nbsp; Forging means that no group gets proportionally more wealthy at the expense of another group.&nbsp; There is no transfer of wealth at all - no pot of gold,&nbsp; just churning that in the long run changes nobody's status in the NXT hierarchy.<br /><br />So stop thinking that the key to &quot;securing the network&quot; is to tinker with forging allocations so more people are seduced to participate and add their computers to the NXT network.&nbsp; This logic negates NXT's key advantage over Bitcoin - that only one block calculation is needed to add to the blockchain, not a thousand million billion.&nbsp; We are cooperative where Bitcoin is cutthroat competitive.&nbsp; By being cooperative, we choose one person to do the next block and so we don't need a huge number of forging computers on our network.&nbsp; Our defense against DDoS is not lots of forging computers, it is that we cooperate to chose a single back-up block creator if the primary block-creator is taken out of commission.&nbsp; NXT gets the job done with a network vastly more efficient than Bitcoin's.<br /><br />SO accept and embrace the current distribution of wealth in NXT.&nbsp; If you want to get wealthy in this proof-of-stake coin, go buy some stake in it while it is still dirt cheap. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>fantastic post!!<br />

I guess as the price changes more than 1% intraday, you would need to update the quotes. With the 2% spread you have, you could wait even longer, but probably 1% change would be the trigger. To sell back the shortNXT it seems I have to pick the times near the lowest price of the day or it will reset back to 100<br /><br />If I have this right, what prevents someone from buying a bunch and waiting for a big volatile down day?<br /><br />James
