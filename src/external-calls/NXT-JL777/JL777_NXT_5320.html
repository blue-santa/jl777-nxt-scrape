Obviously skill and experience aren't just thrown out the window, but I can tell you that 95% of this greed hungry community will be struggling to break-even, let alone make profit.

The world can see everything you do and I know it cannot take off until that is fixed.<br /><br />Call it privacy instead of anonymity.

But dividends will be paid in NXT. Thus bitcoins will be sold for NXT, the result being a flow of capital into NXT and out of other cryptos.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Why do you assume dividends will be in NXT?<br />For example NXTcoinsco will issue dividends in nodecoin, SVMcoin, bannercoin, etc.<br />NXTventure issues dividends that are assets of its offerings<br />NXThaus can issue dividends in BTC asset or even USD asset!<br /><br />NXT AE is truly fantastic. I dont think most people understand all the possibilities. I am trying to demonstrate by example the variety possible with AE. It can be a proxy for BTC or any external crypto. I can be a coin like nodecoin or MIC! It can represent an operating company. It can represent a portfolio of other assets. I can represent a managed trading fund. It can represent call options, put options, butterfly spreads, etc. etc. Dont forget real world representations, eg. donut assets and pizza assets. Its time for lunch!<br /><br />James

Also, if the payment is based on the ownership ratio at a specific block, why do you need to know whey they got the asset?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are right in my special case paying dividends depend on when the first time that asset sold from issuer. The first time is important for me not sure that will be important for others.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is why I asked!<br />OK, so you actually need three things. You need to know the date the asset sold for the first time from your account. Do you ALWAYS sell, or sometimes transfer, eg. they send manual payment and you transfer instead of using AE.<br /><br />Do you need the above data to calculate the total dividend payout, or is it unrelated tracking of overall sales?<br />if the latter, I would like to take care of dividend calcs first<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes! I sometimes Transfer! <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" /> I forgot that!<br />No I need the data to calculate the dividends each asset holder should receive. And need the second script to pay it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are you saying you need to track the exact asset across ownership changes and allocate different amounts to each specific asset? If so, that is not possible as assets are fungible. what happens if someone buys asset on Monday and another person buys an asset on Wed, then on thursday they both transfer it to a third person, who then sends half of it to a fourth person.<br /><br />Please tell me how to allocate the Monday asset and Wed asset between the third person and fourth person.<br />This is like mixing. You cant use a fungible asset to represent nonfungible things. The Monday asset is not fungible with the Wed asset, yet the NXT assets are all exactly the same. There are no txin/txout threads to backtrace so any allocation will be a statistical allocation.<br /><br />Might I suggest an alternate approach that has a verifiable solution?<br /><br />For each dividend period calculate the total dividend you are to issue. You can do this from your sales records, yes? So we have Total_dividend. Then separately we find all the asset holders and add up how many assets are in accounts that are not the issuing acct. Now we can calculate the amount each asset should get by dividing Total_dividend by the sum of assets in the wild. From there its easy to allocate to each account.<br /><br />Now, you will notice that people who buy the asset right before the dividend date would dilute the dividends from the people who had it all week. Since everyone can do this, and it only happens the first time the asset is issued, it is hopefully an acceptable compromise. If not we are back to a statistical allocation that is a lot more difficult to implement and prone to bugs<br /><br />If it is a big problem for the edge case of late purchasers, I suggest taking the asset off the market during the last days before the dividend block<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I read your suggestion several times and I think that is the only way we can move froward because as you told the asset is fungible.<br />So we should face it.<br />So I will calculate the to total number of Dividends and you provide the Total number of assets sold till date and to each account it's belong using first script and we will divide their share and pay it using the second script.<br /><br />We cannot take care of which date the person but it all first week purchasers are in the same boat and receive same dividend shares.<br />And the same happen for all that purchased our Asset in first two weeks at the end of 2nd week.<br /><br />I explain again in other words to avoid misunderstandings because of my second language weak skills!<br /><br />If agreed let's code it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am glad we came to consensus on this. <br />It turns out that there is no easy way to find out all AE transactions in a block with current NXT API, so I will have to implement that first. Then I will be able to hookup my asset tracking to it and will be able to output JSON of total assets and all the accounts with their asset totals as of a specific block<br /><br />What this means is that you will have to subtract out the issued but unpurchased assets in your account from the calculations. I couldnt think of a general way to ignore these issued but unpurchased assets for all cases and rather than do something that will be 99% effective, I think it is safer to have each asset issuer do this adjustment themselves.<br /><br />all you have to do is subtract your unbound (issued but not purchased) assets from the combined total<br />then use that adjusted total as the denominator for your asset holders.<br /><br />Once I get this working, please, please verify that the latest totals matches what is in people's accounts. It is brand new untested code and this is real money. Need to verify accuracy manually.<br /><br />Sending out payments is a totally different issue, so I will do that after the hard part is done<br /><br />James

I have settled on the 2 hour timeframe as the best tradeoff between the chaos of 5 minute timeframes and minimizing large external event.<br /><br />Now crypto doesnt have anywhere near the historical database so any predictor will necessarily be highly curve fitted and much less useful for actual prediction. I used 5 year+ datasets for my forex predictors.<br /><br />I had finally achieved realtime verified breakeven results using an autobot. Overcome the bid/ask spread, commissions is actually quite an achievement. It was just the first iteration of the complete system. Then I discovered crypto, so it has been on hold for 5 months.<br /><br />James<br /><br />Edit: I am so backlogged with other projects I wont have a chance to push forward on the SVMcoin for a while. I am hopeful that there is an adventurous C programmer that will want to help predict the future

It might seem over complicated but it is actually much simpler than any real world multinational conglomerate.<br />A shortcut is to just get jl777hodl, it gets approx 10% piece of most of the non-proxy assets:<br /><br />Bithaus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6'540&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;400'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.64%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;163'500<br />InstantDEX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1'000'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.00%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2'751'000<br />MGW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1'000'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.00%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 110'000<br />NXTautoDAC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;750'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.00%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1'200'750<br />NXTcoinsco&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1'000'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.00%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1'800'000<br />NXTsharks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;250'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.00%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />NXTventure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1'000'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.00%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2'300'000<br />Sianote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 423&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10'000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.23%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1'037'196<br /><br />

					In addition to the 5.7 million NXT, just got 100 BTC purchase, so that explains why there are fewer sharkfund0 assets in the NXTsharks account than can be accounted for by just the NXT purchases<br /><br />Going back to coding now, so if I dont respond to PM or forum, dont be surprised<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S.

July was the expected launch date, but that was how long I thought it would take to sellout the sharkfund0, since over half is gone already, I guess the timetable has to move up.<br /><br />There are very few assets of NXTsharks available. With an expected 10+ million investment account, the expected profits would not be insignificant. I am not going to make any specific profitability projections as in crypto it is just not anything that is predictable.<br /><br />NXTsharks is a different type of company. As the sharkfunds grow in size, the profitability potential of NXTsharks grows correspondingly. I will conduct the sale for NXTsharks itself using the AE<br /><br />There will be 25000 assets that will be available. Once there are bids for the 25000 that are acceptable, I will put the sell offer out. I will keep it open for at least a week.<br /><br />James
