					after 4hrs sleep after all nighter due to AE launch I wasnt able to code today,but I did make a breakthrough on the InstantDEX design. now even if evilbob forges the next block and is doing a direct tx with you, the worst he can do is not do the trade he agreed to. considering how rare it will be and it is just an annoyance without any funds lost, I consider this attack vector dealt with!<br /><br />Have a few pretty major things cooking, but not ready to announce anything yet. very exciting times for NXT!!!<br /><br />James

And how much each one holds? And what is their NXT account?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>NXTservices internally updates the asset position of all assets it is tracking. I have made any external interface to that, but now thatI think of it, maybe I did put in an asset field filter for the multigateway acct status.

That might be something that Nxt can emulate.<br /><br />If Nxt can win the market for turing complete programming, the amount of code running on such a network will generate a lot of fees and truth be told, one of the coins (Nxt, Ethereum) will become the default in that race like Bitcoin is the default in the race for store of value.<br /><br />I am on the fence between investing in Ethereum or Nxt but it seems like the Ethereum guys are very focused on their computation platform that allows anyone to build many of Nxt's features on top.<br /><br />So instead of having the core developers of Nxt working on AE and messaging, the Ethereum guys are going to leave all of that up to the independent developer and just focus on getting the platform working. Once they have the computation platform the fees will be pretty good.<br /><br />I feel like the Nxt team is perhaps focusing on the wrong thing. AE is great and all, but the Ethereum guys will have AE on day 3 once someone makes AE on top of the Ethereum platform.<br /><br />Does this make sense? I am rambling a little.<br /><br />I might be wrong, but many people are underestimating the potential of building a platform and letting other people build on top without permission.<br /><br />And this comes back to the fees. 1 nxt default hardcoded just seems like the wrong direction. Forgers need to rewarded? Well gouging all Nxt users won't be a good long term solution. If Nxt had a turing complete platform then their would be a lot of fees as the network and nodes would always be doing work and be active.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think you are a bit confused as to the nature of NXT. NXT is a platform. It is here today. It works. The fee issue is not fundamental, if it is a barrier it can and will be fixed. Right now we have silly exchanges charging 0.5% when the actual cost to them is 1 NXT. This is not a feature of NXT, but a &quot;feature&quot; of the exchange you are using. It is possible to have an exchange that only charges 1 NXT right now, NXT does not prevent that so this anti-0.5% fee thing is not against NXT, it is against the exchanges<br /><br />Please tell me the developers that can create an AE in three days. I am highly skeptical of this claim. Especially the magical independent developers that are simply growing on trees all over the place??<br /><br />Etherium is certainly a respectable competitor of the future, but they will be up against NXT of the future, not NXT as it is today. Just project the rate of progress NXT is making. NXT is getting new devs on a regular basis now, so the rate of new functionality will accelerate.<br /><br />NXT already has a viable crowdsourcing platform, today<br /><br />NXT already has the longest running Proof of Stake network, today<br /><br />NXT is written in java and while a lot of anti-java people seem to think it is a disadvantage, it is actually quite an advantage in the financial field. java is very widespread in financial field and it runs on zillions of devices. I am a C guy, and even I see the big advantage of java<br /><br />NXT has no central bottleneck for decision making. If ANY NXT'er decides to do something, they just do it, or fund it.<br /><br />As far as financial performance of etherium goes, my projection is that they will raise a record setting amount of funds for a crypto. A truly staggering amount. Once all that money goes in, who will be left to buy it? I will wait until it hits the market and goes through the first big correction after they announce some delays in releasing. I can almost guarantee that they will not meet their delivery deadline. I know this because it is universally true for software, especially complex cutting edge software.<br /><br />Originally NXT AE was supposed to come out in the end of Jan. In December I was saying that it was not wise to count on that and that there will most likely be delays. 3 months and a bit later we have AE and it is a much improved version with NQT and QNT and also super slick GUI.<br /><br />Investing in etherium before they have a working system seems a lot riskier to me than investing in NXT. Of course, with great risk comes little reward. Ooops, shouldnt that be with great risk comes great reward? Do the math. If etherium raises $100 million, it will have to go to $1 billion market cap to get a tenfold increase. Is that possible, sure. But how likely is it for NXT to go from $30million market cap to $300 million? That is the fundamental question to answer if you are trying to choose.<br /><br />James

Of course, this actually justifies lowering the tx fee as if the blockchain is bloating that means we are getting a lot more fees. Im guesstimating we will double forging revenues if we go to 0.1 NXT min tx, it might take a little while for the services to take advantage of the lower fee to arrive, but within a month or two we would see this.<br /><br />I think jean-luc agrees with me that I am right in this guesstimate or at least in the right ballpark, so that means we will have 20 times the transactions. 20 times! So, I think it is prudent that before we do that that we get everything internally prepared in the code. We just deployed AE and got hit with massive forking. NQT is still very new. I know that all of the AE tx are still in RAM and it needs to go into DB<br /><br />A little more patience and we will be able to reduce fees and boost activity to the next order of magnitude.<br /><br />I will make InstantDEX not charge anything for changing of bid or ask, so not only will people be able to get much faster trades, they will be able to change their quotes without getting hit with a fee each time. NXT AE has transformed NXT into not only a decentralized exchange, but also a viable method for crowdfunding.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Exactly, not only will we earn more from transaction fees but NXT will be bigger with many more transactions and thus raising its price and stakeholders will profit as well. IMO now that AE is live we should focus on this for now. It&#039;s something much easier to implement than AE.<br /><br />In fact, I would like to propose a bounty for mintxperbyte.<br />NXT transaction fee is too expansive. Bitcoin is huge and charges over 4,5 cents however we are so small compared to it and we charge nearly that (3,2 cents) and unexperienced users will pay an even higher dishonest fee based on % (please remove that already)<br />Today blockchain can easily be extremely be bloated with only a few hundred dollars using a very easy method I will not disclose right now. I already reported it to cfb and wesleyh but seems it didn&#039;t receive much attention. I can double the blockchain size in a few minutes wasting less than 500 dollars. Banks would be happy to spend much more to burn nxt.<br />NXT is not only a form of transfer money like bitcoin. It also has message, ae, alias and many more things. Minfeeperbyte would tax information based on its size and not on importance or anything else we THINK is important. Blockchain bloating and safety is important and that&#039;s it.<br /><br />NXT is worth 3,2 cents right now. I propose a 0,001 nxt fee per byte (0,001/byte). Transfer of NXT have 160 bytes so as of now it would cost 0,001*160=0,16 nxt to transfer any amount of nxt. That&#039;s only 0,512 cents. Yes, cents not dollars. Half a cent and not half a dollar. Nearly 10x cheaper than bitcoin! Imagine how much we could do marketing on this! Messages would be taxed based on their size and so on.<br />Also, mintxperbyte is much more smarter than thinking fees for everything we implement.<br />We can change it later to something like 0,0008 if nxt value rises or 0,0015 if it goes down etc.<br />I hope you get what I mean, I&#039;ve lost grasp of writing english and it&#039;s very late.<br /><br />If the idea catches on, I&#039;d like to start the bounty with 5000 nxt. People may (and are more than welcome!) to chime in if they agree<br />EDIT: I thought the idea deserved a thread so I created it. <a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/bounty-for-mintxperbyte/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/bounty-for-mintxperbyte/</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Other than the complexity of estimating the mintx fee, this is an interesting idea. Also, this does not change the cost at all for applications that use the full 1K for AM, as 1000 * .001 = 1NXT<br />So, it wont spur the deployment of new applications.<br /><br />Maybe if it was .00025 NXT per byte with a min of 0.1 NXT, then it would achieve the desired goals?<br />It would be 75% less expensive for a fully loaded AM, 10 times cheaper for a simple tx or any tx less than 400 bytes<br /><br />I believe this would require every node to calculate the mintx for every tx to make sure it has the min required and for the GUI to be able to get an exact minfee before sending all tx. Not the biggest technical challenges, but also not something that is to be underestimated<br /><br />James

All this financial monkey business has nothing to do with actual industry, so literally anything can happen to the prices, at least for a long while.<br /><br />Also, a big drop in silver value relative to gold is due to photographic film that used a lot of silver nitrate being almost totally replaced by digital cameras<br /><br />All that being said, I too, like shiny things.

Of course, this actually justifies lowering the tx fee as if the blockchain is bloating that means we are getting a lot more fees. Im guesstimating we will double forging revenues if we go to 0.1 NXT min tx, it might take a little while for the services to take advantage of the lower fee to arrive, but within a month or two we would see this.<br /><br />I think jean-luc agrees with me that I am right in this guesstimate or at least in the right ballpark, so that means we will have 20 times the transactions. 20 times! So, I think it is prudent that before we do that that we get everything internally prepared in the code. We just deployed AE and got hit with massive forking. NQT is still very new. I know that all of the AE tx are still in RAM and it needs to go into DB<br /><br />A little more patience and we will be able to reduce fees and boost activity to the next order of magnitude.<br /><br />I will make InstantDEX not charge anything for changing of bid or ask, so not only will people be able to get much faster trades, they will be able to change their quotes without getting hit with a fee each time. NXT AE has transformed NXT into not only a decentralized exchange, but also a viable method for crowdfunding.<br /><br />James

Might require waiting for a block or two given the current system. <br />Nevertheless a great project. <br /><br />Read more under 'instant transaction proposal' in this same subtopic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I believe I have solved the evil forger attack. Kudos to mczarnek for pointing out this evil, evil scheme!<br /><a href="https://nxtforum.org/instant-transactions/instant-transaction-proposal-1089/msg20183/#msg20183" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/instant-transactions/instant-transaction-proposal-1089/msg20183/#msg20183</a><br /><br />I think the worst that happens is that after an average of 30 seconds to the next block you find out that an instant tx was aborted, but atomicity is preserved. Meaning, the trade either happens or doesnt. Unless evil bob is around the trade will succeed and I felt that anybody with enough NXT to forge a decent number of blocks wouldnt bother with cheating, I still wanted to close the window on evil bob&#039;s fingers. In a different thread someone pointed out that leased forging changes the equation and indeed it does, if we have an evil leasepool operator all of a sudden it becomes believable that he would stoop to stealing from poor Alice.<br /><br />I am glad to hear feedback on my solution as I am eager to finalize InstantDEX coding.<br /><br />James

As of right now there are 72,000 bithaus assets that are bound and in circulation. I dont want artificial scarcity to pump the price out of proportion<br /><br />aldrin will also add to this and I expect the total in circulation to get to 108,000 assets in the short term. At anytime you can check the parkinglot acct 6917879084634468097 <br />The difference between 400000 and the amount in the parkinglot acct is the amount in circulation.<br /><br />James

So, your stake in NXTcoinsco determines your share of the newly created coins and they will accumulate on your behalf.<br /><br />At anytime you can withdraw them into your NXT account. No need for special accounts as they can just be sent to your NXT account as an asset. <br /><br />You can view it as parallel mining of all NXTcoinsco coins and all NXTcoinsco asset holders are essentially in one giant pool. The element of chance is removed and everybody gets a steady stream of NXTcoinsco coins directly proportional to their ownership percentage.<br /><br />AE is fantastic!<br /><br />James<br /><br />
