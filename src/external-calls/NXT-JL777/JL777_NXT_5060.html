AT as a part of nxt core will not be monetized, all funcionalities will be freely available to everyone! A high level language will be created regadless nxtAT . NxtAT asset is made for the first company that will create ATs using the current state and until the HLL language is completed it will offer support and consulting services to anyone interested to create his own ATs . With that way nxtAT will be able to provide further development to AT without needing donations. Hope that clears some thinks. I have also read that the price isbtoo high. The total value in nxt is approximately 20M like the InstantDex asset. You think instantDex is more valued than nxtAt and nxtAt should be less?<br /><br />Sent from my GT-I9100 using Tapatalk<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I dont want to publicly discuss my estimated valuation of a software consulting company whose market is the time between release of AT and release of AT HLL.<br /><br />People can look at my jl777hodl acct NXT-2AHU-UXZW-K9Q2-HENLW and see which assets that I did not issue that I purchased, lets leave it at that<br /><br />James

You only have two MGW trigger events. Deposit + Withdrawal. Deposit=Deposit from external coin and asset is added to NXT account. Withdrawal=Asset is withdrawn from AE, and coin is sent to external wallet.<br /><br />A. Deposit.<br />Deposit request occurs (external request sent to MWG).<br />Multisig wallet is created, and funds are lodged in that wallet.<br />When confirmed, coin deposit details are entered into central list, agreed upon by the 3MGW.<br />One of the MGWs does the asset deposit, using a state machine to make sure it's only done once.<br /><br />B Withdrawal.<br />The MGW is continually polling all the NXT addresses, looking for withdrawals from MGW assets.<br />When found, they are added to a central list, once again agreed by all 3 MGWs, order is also agreed.<br />Going through the list one by one, funds are sent from central MGW wallet back onto external blockchain.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There is a third significant event, the request for deposit addresses. until someone gets a deposit address, MGW basically cant do anything for them. The user publishes AM that requests a multisig deposit addr, the MGW servers coordinate and one of them pubishes AM with the multisig deposit addr<br /><br />Now, MGW is also monitoring all bitcoind blocks (and LTC, DOGE, DRK, etc) and when it sees a multisig address it has issued, this triggers a transfer of assets to the user's acct corresponding with the deposit<br /><br />I just take the (NXT addr % NUM_GATEWAYS) to choose which gateway does the actual asset transfer, but all three are independently doing all the other calculations. They all have independently updated asset lists and NXT acct specific asset tx list<br /><br />MGW does not need to monitor all NXT addr, just all NXT blocks and whenever there is a transfer of a BTC asset back to the MGW, this creates a withdrawal request. Hopefully the asset xfer that did this has a comment field validating destination, if not it will default to an address that was registered when requesting multisig deposit address<br /><br />The reason why I dont think MGW will be a tempting target for hackers is that there is NO CENTRAL WALLET! Internally I create a virtual wallet that is composed of the sum of all unspent outputs from all the depositor's multisig accts. That also means no sweep transaction, as soon as a deposit gets enough confirmations, the MGW virtual balance is adjusted.<br /><br />Here comes the part that automatically establishes MGW consensus. Not sure if you know about rawtransactions and how to make them. Trust me, it is not as easy as it sounds. Every detail of the tx needs to be specified in the precise syntax. Then at the end of it you get a bunch of bytes that is the transaction. It is these bytes that all MGW servers need to agree on, exactly. So that means every detail of the tx is the same. This means the order of withdrawal processing is critical.You need a deterministic algo to define all the tx parameters and it has to end up with the identical rawtx bytes on all three MGW server.<br /><br />To make it even less of a target, over time, all the MGW multisig deposit addresses will converge to the average balance. Even if someone deposits 100 BTC or 0.1 BTC, over time they will both end up with around the average deposit. I am guessing around 1 BTC, maybe a bit more.<br /><br />So a hacker would have to somehow compromise servers that are independently managed and then construct the rawtx bytes, get them signed to be able to steal 1 BTC. With active monitoring by the other servers and nodes running the MGW client, even if this unlikely event happens,we will find out right away and send in the dobermans<br /><br />James

Status is: I can run a jsonrpc server, and also talk to it. I can also do this in my app, which I am reconfiguring to run w/o gui.<br /><br />Now what I can do is launch a server in my app, and speak to that server in my app, and have a function called in my app, and talk back to the client that called in on the port.<br /><br />Now the bad thing (I almost expected it): the jsonrpc server is blocking. This means that I can send a call the Nxt api,<br />the api calls the NRS, gets back a result, but the rpc thread can't get it, because it is runing in its own thread-scope or however they call it.<br /><br />This is darn frustrating. So this is using the 'easy' (haha) server in the lib. But of course, there are also non-blocking threaded servers. I'll just have to check how to use them.<br /><br />Basically the issue is that I can receive a request from a client, but because I am only a bridge in front of the Nxt api, I now have to tell the calling socket to wait until I return, take the request, and send it to the NRS api. <br />When that gets back, I have to pick up the waiting socket, and send the reply back to the caller over the port.<br /><br />That is pretty darn non-trivial. But an interesting challenge. So we'll see if it can be broken.<br /><br />I had a similar challenge with the Qt threads themselves. Turns out that for years everybody in the Qt world including their own documentation described the process in a subtly incorrect manner, which caused all kinds of confusion. Until maybe only a year ago or so, when some C++ freaks cleared the misunderstanding. But it is still difficult, esp. since the best description out there is in C++.<br /><br />But I do think that such a bridge will be tremendously useful!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You can always learn C <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />NXTservices already has all the thread management and all the bitcoind_RPC interface and of course all the NXT API<br /><br />James

By saying &quot;longest&quot; we mean one with the highest cumulative difficulty. Majority of bitcoiners are geeks and such &quot;mathematical&quot; approach is very appealing to them.<br /><br />Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-fork" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Fork</a> that happened in March 2013 clearly showed that the longest chain rule is not enough. This rule doesn't work in extraordinary situations, but we don't have two Bitcoin branches so what fixed that problem? Some might argue that Bitcoin is centralized and Bitcoin users follow orders of Bitcoin devs, but BCNext thinks that the correct answer is &quot;Economic Majority&quot;. This term was coined by <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Economic_majority" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Meni Rosenfeld</a>. In plain English it means that majority of users decided to abandon one of the branches and stick together even by violating the Rule.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is completely wrong. It's not &quot;the longest chain&quot;, it's &quot;the longest chain that conforms to the protocol&quot;. <br />The problem occurred because protocol changed and nobody noticed that in time.&nbsp; <br /><br />The exact same thing will happen in NXT if nodes in a cluster are running different versions and there's an unseen hard fork introducing bug.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">BCNext decided to use this phenomenon to resolve extraordinary problems happening in Nxt. Nodes accept freshly forged blocks according to the longest chain rule, but when something happens they follow the economic majority. Economic laws can't be ignored (history of Soviet Union proves that), by respecting these laws we actually make Nxt stronger.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You can't know what is the economic majority. You can only estimate that. &quot;Majority of nodes&quot; is a much worse estimator than &quot;majority of stake&quot;. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Let's conduct a thought experiment. Imagine that network splitted for 24 hours and there are 2 competing branches. Thousands transactions are processed, thousands goods are delivered to the buyers. Now the network is merged and we see that the longest chain contains only 30% of the transactions but the shortest the rest 70%.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That's impossible, unless you count a transaction of 1 nxt as equal to 1000 nxt, which is trivial to exploit. The chain with majority of stake, that is, 70% of transaction amount, wins. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Another experiment. 20% of Bitcoin economy that owns 65% of hashing power decided to fork Bitcoin and add unlimited supply of the coins. Let's assume that they would mine 25 BTC per block forever. There are no other differences. What blockchain will a new user download? Of coz the one with unlimited supply because &quot;the longest chain wins&quot;. Will the user agree on that? I doubt he will chose 20% of economy instead of 80%. And again we see that economic laws are more important than &quot;mathematical&quot; ones.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Again, what? That's against the protocol and impossible. The same logic allows for doublespends if 51% of miners produce them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>@lruu, you are clearly much smarter than me, so I wont debate the details with you.<br /><br />I do want to know if this is like the blockchain fifo thread, where you were stating technical &quot;facts&quot; to support your opinion that you didnt want to have nodes that didnt have the full blockchain. You made categorical statements that contradicted what I was saying I thought would be possible, but in the end it turned out that what I was thinking was possible, was possible but you just didnt like it.<br /><br />How can people know if what you are stating is actually pure technical 1+1= 2 type of truths, or if you are coloring it to support an outcome that you want.<br /><br />What is the outcome that you want? I cant tell. If people cant trust you to state the technical facts without coloring it with your desired outcomes, then that means you need to tell us what you want to convince people of so we can temper your technical &quot;facts&quot; with your agenda.<br /><br />James

This actually proves that NXT universe is expanding. At first, it is natural to be a little wary. <br /><br />TXTcoins raised funds for his NXT venture and people invested in him. Now I have no experience at all with payment trade shows, but TXTcoins feels strongly about the direct value to NXT and thus the indirect value to his platform about NXT attending.<br /><br />He did put NXT that he had full control over for what is essentially a public benefit to all of NXT. I think that deserves note, especially since he knows that he might even get some flak over it from some of his asset holders.<br /><br />Now what if he knows how these trade shows works? What if he is able to get NXT linked up with some major payment house? Maybe that is why he is supporting the trade show so much. Since this is NXT's first tradeshow of this genre, we probably cant expect a bunch of closed deals during the trade show. However,&nbsp; cointropolis and justabit will be there, so if there are deals to be made, they will be made. This we know from their track record.<br /><br />When I first came to NXT community, there were a lot of people who called me all sorts of things, few of them nice. In fact, some are still repeating such things about me. I can tell you as a newcomer, I was very much affected by such negativity and it took strong support from people like aldrin to get me through.<br /><br />I would like to think that I have contributed to NXT and made it better for all NXT'ers. Lets understand that the NXT community has different &quot;rules&quot; and expectations from most other communities. I prefer to give people the benefit of doubt until there is some sort of evidence.<br /><br />James

No, the small country of 11 million has not decided to stop making chocolate or waffles. It has decided to increase its buying of U.S. Treasury bonds... in a very big way. According to latest U.S. Treasury Department data, since August of 2013 entities in Belgium have purchased and held a stunning $215 billion of U.S. Treasuries. This figure is equivalent to about half the country's annual GDP, and equates to almost $20,000 for every living Belgian. Prior to that time, Belgium had held its cache fairly steady at around $170-$190 billion. But by March, that total had increased by almost 130% (to $381 billion) in just seven months. The purchases represented 61% of the total increase in foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries over that time frame. Given the fact that Belgium, as of last September, had less than 3% of the Treasury bonds held by foreign sources, this is strange behavior indeed.</em></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><strong>looks like Belgium is in a panic.</strong><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><em>What is clear is that this is not likely the government of Belgium, or private Belgian capital, that is doing the buying.

By saying &quot;longest&quot; we mean one with the highest cumulative difficulty. Majority of bitcoiners are geeks and such &quot;mathematical&quot; approach is very appealing to them.<br /><br />Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-fork" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Fork</a> that happened in March 2013 clearly showed that the longest chain rule is not enough. This rule doesn't work in extraordinary situations, but we don't have two Bitcoin branches so what fixed that problem? Some might argue that Bitcoin is centralized and Bitcoin users follow orders of Bitcoin devs, but BCNext thinks that the correct answer is &quot;Economic Majority&quot;. This term was coined by <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Economic_majority" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Meni Rosenfeld</a>. In plain English it means that majority of users decided to abandon one of the branches and stick together even by violation the Rule.<br /><br />BCNext decided to use this phenomenon to resolve extraordinary problems happening in Nxt. Nodes accept freshly forged blocks according to the longest chain rule, but when something happens they follow the economic majority. Economic laws can't be ignored (history of Soviet Union proves that), by respecting these laws we actually make Nxt stronger.<br /><br />Let's conduct a thought experiment. Imagine that network splitted for 24 hours and there are 2 competing branches. Thousands transactions are processed, thousands goods are delivered to the buyers. Now the network is merged and we see that the longest chain contains only 30% of the transactions but the shortest the rest 70%. Which network will win? BCNext thinks that the shortest one, coz economic majority will decide to lose less than more (we assume that loss is proportional to number of rolled back transactions), and I tend to agree with him. The reader is free to have another opinion of coz.<br /><br />Another experiment. 20% of Bitcoin economy that owns 65% of hashing power decided to fork Bitcoin and add unlimited supply of the coins. Let's assume that they would mine 25 BTC per block forever. There are no other differences. What blockchain will a new user download? Of coz the one with unlimited supply because &quot;the longest chain wins&quot;. Will the user agree on that? I doubt he will chose 20% of economy instead of 80%. And again we see that economic laws are more important than &quot;mathematical&quot; ones.<br /><br />Nxt uses economic laws to help a node to choose among thousands branches. In some cases this is supposed to happen automatically. For example, if Alice and Walmart are on different branches then she can't buy anything coz Walmart won't see her transaction. The things are more complicated for Walmart, it have to invest into servers all rely on other market participants. If a new user joins Nxt and there are several blockchains he should just ask friends, who brought him there, what blockchain to download (hash of a recent block is enough).<br /><br />If one knows accounts of &quot;big&quot; market players he can analyze the blockchain to make sure that he keeps sticking to the majority.<br /><br />PS: Well, I hope I didn't forget anything important. I'll add it if I did.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>CfB you are my hero! <br /><br />Thank you for your longest post ever! <br /><br />This is clearly an important issue and I am glad it is explained in terms without so much jargon<br /><br />Basically, math is good, until evil forces abuse the situation to make the math favorable to them, in that case common sense trumps math. Did I get that right?<br /><br />James

I think everyone is waiting for it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am struggling with the current method of tracking account balances. It works, but it is too complicated for me to make changes to it easily.<br />This is usually a sign that it need to be reworked.<br /><br />Now I am very reluctant to make wholesale changes at this point, but the fact that after two days of trying to make a &quot;simple&quot; change (the three MGW servers dont agree on which withdrawal to do next and deadlocks) I am at the point of biting the bullet and reworking it.<br /><br />So, I need some help and other eyes to make sure that after this reworking MGW balances will be totally accurate.<br /><br />Now that I sped up reprocessing 100 times, I can consider more brute force methods as opposed to the current state machine method. As it is, any error anywhere, ever, would propagate forever. While my code has very low error rates, the forever propagation concerns me, especially if a HDD hiccup or network glitch can introduce an error.<br /><br />Here is my plan.<br /><br />Now that I have asset dividend calculations precise at any block, I can build on that. Internally, each NXT acct with an asset tx history has every asset tx that it ever did in a linear list. The number of transactions for any given user will be small compared to CPU speed, so linear is fine and so will recalculating everything from scratch.<br /><br />Instead of a complex state machine that needs to make sure it has grabbed different events at different places in the right order to prevent any double transfers but to always make sure exactly one transfer is made, I can scan the list of asset tx and see if anything should be done. I think this greatly simplifies things as I can even now visualize the possible variations.<br /><br />Ignoring how many confirmations a tx has, we have these trigger conditions:<br />A) external blockchain deposit but no corresponding NXT asset xfer<br />B) NXT asset withdrawal, but no external blockchain payment<br /><br />Really it seems so simple now, I wonder why I had problems with this? So, I am concerned that I am missing some cases.<br /><br />Since each NXT asset tx already has an entry and I even already defined a *cointxid ptr (unused) in the structure, I guess I knew something like this was needed. I already have the list of external blockchain deposits and it has fields to indicate completion, I think the simplifying factor here is that I will end up with just one list per NXT acct.<br /><br />Since one of the three MGW will actually issue the asset xfer, the best way to sync the state of all three is for them to update the list with the binding of external blockchain deposit to NXT asset list when they see the asset xfer. Just need to make sure that the server that does the asset xfer doesnt do more than one. That means RAM based state variable for this and waiting N blocks on startup before doing any transfers to satisfy an external blockchain deposit.<br /><br />If the above is good, we now have a totally synchronized state of deposits (after the asset xfer appears on the blockchain), during the time it is pending one of the MGW servers will have a different state. There is potential here of an &quot;attack&quot; by someone depositing all the time to get the three servers in a different state. To avoid this deposit attack, I think all I have to do is, nothing. As long as I am just scanning the list of the NXT acct's asset tx and dont credit any account until N blocks have passed, only what has appeared on the blockchain will affect the MGW's crediting of each account. The suppression of sending more than one transfer shouldnt affect the balance calculation, so I think I can ignore the &quot;deposit attack&quot;<br /><br />OK, now I just need a deterministic way to select the NXT account to process. It seems a bit brute force, but 20,000 is a small number to a CPU and no asset has anywhere near that number of asset holders. I have a list of all asset tx for each asset, so I just scan that list for all NXT accts and scan each NXT acct's list for any required withdrawal processing. I need a timestamp of the block in which the withdrawal request came in (via asset xfer), then I can just process them in order of NXT acct #, or withdrawal size, doesnt matter as all three MGW servers should have the same lists<br /><br />Once the three MGW servers are in agreement on the order of withdrawals that need to be processed, that solves the last sticking point. All external blockchain tx will map onto a NXT asset tx. I can verify that no tx is processed until N confirmations. I think processing one withdraw at a time will be fast enough as it can do several per minute, which is thousands of withdraws per day.<br /><br />If the above is good, I can code it up and finally release it for testing.<br />Feedback please. MGW is super important and I want to have more than just me to verify the highlevel algo<br /><br />James<br />

Until the last day, it was sustainable price increase, but now it sure feels a bit bubbly. Of course, if all the LTC holders decide they like DRK better, then we still have a ways to go.<br /><br />The thing is that until it starts dropping there is nothing to slow it down and unlike AUR, DRK actually has some unique values. I would expect a bit of profit taking down to .02, but probably gets support somewhere there. We are still in the rising phase of the mania. When everybody who didnt buy DRK because they thought it couldnt go any higher, finally buy so they wont miss this moontrip.<br /><br /><strong>That is the top. I predict sometime in the next 24 to 48 hrs. </strong>The tricky thing is that it could easily go to .05<br />One thing is clear, even after the manic peak, it will settle at significantly higher than .01<br />Until we see the peak, cant really estimate the new baseline<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Looks like you were right... It's crashing right now.<br />Only question, is it temporary ?<br />I sold 75 % of by Darkcoins. just to be safe...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You do all the pretty charts right?<br />Could you chart DRK/NXT ratio? <br />Another one would be DRK/MRO<br />and maybe even MRO/XC<br /><br />That would help me make some predictions, but no guarantees about accuracy as this is all highly speculative. Would be most convenient if it would be in Sharktales thread as I might miss it in this busy thread<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. The key to finding the reversal is to track the money flows between MRO, XC and DRK. The NXT ratio is a sanity benchmark. Based on float, ~250 means parity so long term we know this is a ceiling. Short term it is all about the money flows.
