( crypto magic later )<br />If a lot of people send anon-transactions they all send their coins to 1984, so we are mixing them in this account.<br /><br />to proof to bob that alice actually send this coins to him, alice groups her coins in blocks of 50 coins, we will call this ShadowBlocks ( amount may vary, but amount values are predefiened, e.g. 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 ... )<br />for every ShadowBlock alice creates a special publickey that only bob has the corresponding private key.<br />for that alice creates an own keypair, adds the public key to bobs public key, and the resulting key is also a public key that bob can create the privatekey if he adds the private key of that block to his own privatekey.<br /><br />similar to this: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=84569.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=84569.0</a><br /><br />alice puts the transaction ID of her transaction to 1984, along with every block ( blockamount, publickey, special public key ) in a message and sends this data to account 1984.<br /><br />bobs sees the meassage on the blockchain and checks if he can create a privatekey that correesponds to the special public key, if he is successful, he can claim the coins when he wants to.<br />It is in bobs interrest to let those coins sit in the 1984 account until he needs to, so that his coins mix up with all the other transactions.<br /><br />If bob can proof that he knows the privatekey to one of the blocks that were sent to 1984, he can claim those coins and request to credit them to another account.<br />So bob wants to claim one of the 50 NXT Blocks:<br />To not reveal which block he owns, he requests the forger to encrypt a very large number with block pubkeys that he provides ( choosing many different blocks the he dosnt know the answer to, and only one block that he knows, all blocks must be of the same amount - 50 NXT) the forger then publishes the sha256 hash of his number, and the many encrypted versions of his number, bob now can get this number by encrypting &quot;his&quot; block, and tell the forger his secret number, along with the sha256 of that number which is already broadcasted this is public prove the he owns one of the blocks with a specific amount, without reveling which block he owns. bobs then gets that amount of nxt sent to an id he provides, from the 1984 account.<br />To avoid doublespend bob is not allowed to ever use one of the blocks he used in this transaction.<br /><br />Bob does this three times, cleverly mixing his blocks, and he got his 150 NXT, no one can tell who sent him this coins, or if it was one person, or two or three different persons who sent him NXT.<br /><br />It is in bobs interrest to choose blocks in a way that will not reveal where he got those coins from, for further payouts he should use blocks that came from the same transactions as the ones he previously used, basically bob is responsible for his own coin-mixing.<br /><br />Bob cam claim his coins at any time, the longer he lets them sit in the 1984 account, the &quot;more anonymized&quot; his transactions will be.<br /><br />if alice wantet to send 150 NXt to bob, and 320 NXT to vitctor, she could do this too, sending 470 NXT to 1984, split them up in blocks, and choose the special pubkey so that every reciever could only use his NXT, and put all those blocks for both recipients into one message.<br /><br /><br />I hope this is understandable, my english is not perfect <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Clever, but it doesn't seem too user friendly. There is no simple way to know how much next you have in the 1984 account. You would basically have to write down every transaction on pen and paper. Your idea of per-defined amounts would be very useful though.<br /><br />What if Alice sends a transaction of one of those predefined amounts to the 1984 account. The 1984 account creates a random password and associates its hash it with that amount on a single block side chain, I will call it a shadow chain. It sends the password back to Alice on a single block side-chain for her to copy and paste (or write down) somewhere safe. She then clicks ok when she is finished and her side-chain is deleted and written over by the next side chain somebody else uses (that way it is completely gone forever). Alice (or one of her friends) then sends a message with that password and Bob's NXT address on another one block side-chain. The 1984 account checks the password's hash against the hashes in it's database and deletes the side chain for it to be written over again. It then sends that amount of NXT to Bob and deletes the shadow chain and writes over it with another shadow chain for somebody else.<br /><br /><br />Advantages of this approach:<br /><br />All side chains are written over by the end so there is no data left to prove who sent who what amount<br />Bob can receive his NXT in only a few blocks.<br />Only the amount owed is stored (not the exact coins) so Bob receives whatever NXT 1984 spits out rather than the NXT that Alice sent to the 1984 account.<br />Because the data is stored on chains that are written over, it does not bloat the blockchain too much.<br /><br />Disadvantages of this approach:<br /><br />A bug on Alice's computer could trace the person she sent it to, leaving both parties exposed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>once there is any way to do this, it can all be automated.<br />I think it is better to split this into two halfs. One half is the implementation of a &quot;pay to secret&quot; or &quot;pay to xxx&quot; half where it binds the NXT in the &quot;1984&quot; acct. There can be no info sent back to the one that binds it as that would negate all privacy, so clearly Alice needs to send hash(X) or some secret that only she knows how to generate along with NXT<br /><br />So now NXT is in the &quot;1984&quot; acct. Alice has the secret that unlocks this, also others know that Alice has done this. So we also need many other people who do this for this to provide privacy. Assuming this, now to spend it, Alice needs a secure and nontraceable way to send the secret to Bob. How about NXTsync encrypted chat? no trace on blockchain and Bob can cash it in and nobody will know for sure it was from Alice or anybody else that bound the NXT in the past.

It is like paying to the first person who provides X such that hash(X) matches a previously pending transaction with such a dependency<br /><br />one fundamental issue is how to allow the redemption from &quot;1984&quot; acct. Since we dont have passphrase for it, you are suggesting core change that just creates new NXT to use to payout or maybe all the nodes agree to reduce the &quot;1984&quot; acct?<br /><br />this needs to be adressed as if somehow the &quot;1984&quot; acct password is cracked, then it will not be good.<br />maybe acct 0 and make that an illegal acct?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok i will write a more detailed example when i have time for it ^^ <br /><br />I was thinking core changes, it would not be too hard to define 1984 as a special acct. that is not allowed to spend NXT using regular transactions,<br />however it can recieve normal transactions, but only spend NXT using special transactions ( or ShadowTransactions, lets stick with the naming scheme xD ), Nodes would recognize these transactions as valid because the include the public proof of knowledge of a privatekey ( basically special transactions that reduces the 1984 balance, increses bobs balance ).<br />so on alices side this would show up as a regular outgoing transaction to 1984, on bobs side this would show up as an incomming ShadowTransaction from 1984, we cant just increase bobs balance without any transaction, those coins have to come from somewhere.<br /><br />EVEN IF one would obtain the Passphrase for that, it would not be any danger because all he could do would be to send regular transactions and the core just would not consider regular outgoing transactions of that account valid, by definition. we could choose any account for that, set the passphrase to something meaningfull like it happen with the genesis account for example.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ah, ok, so prevent &quot;1984&quot; from doing normal outbound tx. That way the millions of NXT in there is safe, OK that should work<br /><br />I had idea to make a referenced tx that would pay out to the first acct who provided X such that sha256(X) in the reftx matches. This by itself doesnt provide privacy, but I think it is a key component. Anybody that has the X essentially controls the NXT bound by the reftx. Also, it cant be double spent, because it is only good for onetime satisfying of the reftx<br /><br />I am deep into MGW control flow now so no space for your algo. Hopefully you can combine it with mine. We already have the referenced tx,so I think it is a matter of pending reftx to scan for these pay to secret tx attempts.<br />The whole reftx needs to be improved as it currently doesnt deal with mczarnek's evil forger attack<br />

( crypto magic later )<br />If a lot of people send anon-transactions they all send their coins to 1984, so we are mixing them in this account.<br /><br />to proof to bob that alice actually send this coins to him, alice groups her coins in blocks of 50 coins, we will call this ShadowBlocks ( amount may vary, but amount values are predefiened, e.g. 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 ... )<br />for every ShadowBlock alice creates a special publickey that only bob has the corresponding private key.<br />for that alice creates an own keypair, adds the public key to bobs public key, and the resulting key is also a public key that bob can create the privatekey if he adds the private key of that block to his own privatekey.<br /><br />similar to this: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=84569.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=84569.0</a><br /><br />alice puts the transaction ID of her transaction to 1984, along with every block ( blockamount, publickey, special public key ) in a message and sends this data to account 1984.<br /><br />bobs sees the meassage on the blockchain and checks if he can create a privatekey that correesponds to the special public key, if he is successful, he can claim the coins when he wants to.<br />It is in bobs interrest to let those coins sit in the 1984 account until he needs to, so that his coins mix up with all the other transactions.<br /><br />If bob can proof that he knows the privatekey to one of the blocks that were sent to 1984, he can claim those coins and request to credit them to another account.<br />So bob wants to claim one of the 50 NXT Blocks:<br />To not reveal which block he owns, he requests the forger to encrypt a very large number with block pubkeys that he provides ( choosing many different blocks the he dosnt know the answer to, and only one block that he knows, all blocks must be of the same amount - 50 NXT) the forger then publishes the sha256 hash of his number, and the many encrypted versions of his number, bob now can get this number by encrypting &quot;his&quot; block, and tell the forger his secret number, along with the sha256 of that number which is already broadcasted this is public prove the he owns one of the blocks with a specific amount, without reveling which block he owns. bobs then gets that amount of nxt sent to an id he provides, from the 1984 account.<br />To avoid doublespend bob is not allowed to ever use one of the blocks he used in this transaction.<br /><br />Bob does this three times, cleverly mixing his blocks, and he got his 150 NXT, no one can tell who sent him this coins, or if it was one person, or two or three different persons who sent him NXT.<br /><br />It is in bobs interrest to choose blocks in a way that will not reveal where he got those coins from, for further payouts he should use blocks that came from the same transactions as the ones he previously used, basically bob is responsible for his own coin-mixing.<br /><br />Bob cam claim his coins at any time, the longer he lets them sit in the 1984 account, the &quot;more anonymized&quot; his transactions will be.<br /><br />if alice wantet to send 150 NXt to bob, and 320 NXT to vitctor, she could do this too, sending 470 NXT to 1984, split them up in blocks, and choose the special pubkey so that every reciever could only use his NXT, and put all those blocks for both recipients into one message.<br /><br /><br />I hope this is understandable, my english is not perfect <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I dont quite understand this, but I feel it is a promising direction. It is like paying to the first person who provides X such that hash(X) matches a previously pending transaction with such a dependency<br /><br />one fundamental issue is how to allow the redemption from &quot;1984&quot; acct. Since we dont have passphrase for it, you are suggesting core change that just creates new NXT to use to payout or maybe all the nodes agree to reduce the &quot;1984&quot; acct?<br /><br />this needs to be adressed as if somehow the &quot;1984&quot; acct password is cracked, then it will not be good.<br />maybe acct 0 and make that an illegal acct?<br />
