I have some scenarios that require brute force logging of all UDP packets from all nodes and Quantum computer from future that cracks encryption. This seems pretty cost prohibitive and also in the future by years. I think it would be much cheaper to simply confiscate a significant number of teleport nodes, eg. all users!, or maybe use the magic radio stuff on each node to just get the info in unencrypted form. Of course coordinating a global confiscation of innocent citizen&#039;s computers will hopefully not be anything that can be done.<br /><br />So we are back to brute force logging of all UDP and Quantum computers from the future.<br />Realistically, I think they wont bother trying to snoop on normal peoples and just put physical surveillance on actual suspected criminals.<br /><br />James</div>

								<div class="post">I got it so that when you send a telepod a response comes back that is a crptographically signed &quot;receipt&quot; for the telepod. With this, it is easy to prove that the destination account received the telepod and signed the receipt.<br /><br />Now, there is a possibility that the destination acct changes the teleport code to not send back this receipt and so he can deny that he got the telepod. At this point, the plan is to resend the telepod, but of course it has already been received, so it will never get confirmed as delivered. Now Mr. evil recipient can go and clone the telepod and as soon as that happens the sender sees it.<br /><br />At this point, sender can conclude the destination acct is cheating him as with all the encryption that is the only acct that can properly decrypt any telepods sent. Of course, Mr evil will say that his computer was compromised, blah, blah, blah like the scammers do.<br /><br />Now I feel that even if someone&#039;s computer is compromised, if the telepod is arriving there, the sender has done his duty and should receive credit for payment. Of course any sort of dispute like this will be like it is now with blockchain tx. You send payment, get a txid, tell the vendor, they say, yes I got it. Now, they can say, our acct was hacked and the payment that came in is gone, but with payment record on the blockchain, you should be receiving proper credit.<br /><br />With telepods and an honest vendor, showing your receipt would be plenty proof, after all after one such incident if they are refusing giving you credit no more business. Since even attempting this requires running a modified client, there is clearly intent to cheat for any vendor trying to do this.<br /><br />I think that placing responsibility on the destination accounts to not allow their computer to get hacked and using a cloning event as acceptable proof will be adequate.<br /><br />However, I could utilize the trustline concept to minimize any risk, but it would add another step and create some delays in release date. The idea is that only one telepod is sent at a time so that until a signed receipt is received nothing else is sent and no telepod would be bigger than the trustline for the destination account. This makes trustlines a two way thing and could make things quite a bit more complicated.<br /><br />Is this worth implementing or can we just rely on receipts and cloning events as proof of payment?<br />The new poll should be whether to implement trustlines for sending.<br /><br />Since the current poll is 90% to allow free teleports and the time frame is on the shorter of 3 months to 1 year, I will plan to make teleporting free this year and add fees early next year. Now even when the teleport fees start, if a person is running a node connected to the supernetwork and is using other services to earn revenue share, I want to make it so that under normal usage people will actually get more in revenue share than they pay in teleport fees. This way, the teleport fee is just reducing how much revenue share they get and I think will be very acceptable for marketplace acceptance.<br /><br />Thanks for all who voted!<br /><br />James</div>

We do need some NXT graphics changed to BTCD graphics and maybe we will get some early releases without any actual teleport functionality.<br /><br />What happened with MGW, just makes me want to caution people from overreacting. MGW was in beta test and still running on my dev servers and then one day the multigateway.org website went live. All of a sudden everyone just assumed that since the website was live, it was all done and peoples kind of went a bit crazy. Nothing had changed as far as the actual software, it was just the website (a very nice one) but since we didnt make it clear it was only website release, everyone just assumed.<br /><br />So, when you start seeing cool GUI&#039;s, its just that a cool looking GUI and does not mean teleport is all done, even if it has a teleport form in it<br /><br />James</div>

Because coins started to stake after 8 hours of maturity, the total # of BTCD during the PoW phase was less than 1.6 million, and ended up being ~1.174 Million BTCD<br /><br />1) Azeh -- 5,386 BTCD<br /><br />2) TorrnA -- 5,386 BTCD<br /><br />3) BTCDdev --5,386 BTCD<br /><br />Further development expenses:<br /><br />Promotion payments before launch: 2,200 BTCD<br /><br />Blog Posts/ Articles: 120<br />Node hosting: 10<br />Games: 90<br />Faucet funding: 3<br />Mac Wallet: 275<br />Windows Wallet: 500<br />Block Explorers: 550<br />OP translations: 360<br />Donations for independent work: 120<br />Media relations trial: 100<br /><br />Anon tech development: 3500 (given to BTCDdev by James for his work)<br />Further development reserved for James after coming on board ~ 1000 (offered to TorrnA and BTCDdev by James)<br /><br />Basically all pre-mine payments we&#039;re made before James joined as core developer.&nbsp; After which, James was offered a bounty for his services, however, said already had enough BTCD that he had bought on the open market and therefore offered his bounty to BTCDdev for his help coding, who didn&#039;t have funds to be able to purchase BTCD on the open market.<br /><br />Furthermore, I (Azeh) was lucky enough to have BTC available in the early days to purchase the majority of the BTCD I hold on the open market and have subsequently funded other aspects of BTCD development with my personal funds.<br /><br />Web Designer: 1000 BTCD<br />BitcoinPRbuzz: 1200 BTCD<br /><br />See below for more details:<br /><br />A portion of the original pre-mine was agreed upon by the three original developers (Azeh, TorrnA, BTCDdev) to be distributed evenly. This was well before the launch of BTCD and was well before any of us had any knowledge that James would agree to come on board to become the core developer for BTCD.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is, before the launch of BTCD the three original members worked for 2 months planning BTCD. Only one member, Azeh (me) had any BTC available to purchase BTCD on the open market.<br /><br />Moreover, as others have said previously, If one wanted they could have bought the equivalent of the entire pre-mine in the early days for a few BTC.<br /><br />Why is this being said now:<br /><br />1) Continued questions from some community members that have asked for more detail about the pre-mine.<br /><br />2) A current web developer has blackmailed the dev team for payment of between 5-15k BTCD payment.&nbsp; If we didn&#039;t oblige, he threatened to come to the forums to disclose this news and spread FUD.<br /><br />3) So we can clear the air and move forward with a clean slate and tell said developer that their services are no longer wanted.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a team member has gone rouge and has threatened the development team and by extension the BTCD community and therefore, I&#039;d like to completely come clean before said member has a chance to spread FUD.<br /><br />This member, out of respect, I&#039;ll leave anonymous and allow him to come out himself if he so chooses.&nbsp; However, this member continues to think that BTCD is some sort of conspiracy that has been concocted to enhance the value of NXT.&nbsp; This member continues to believe this even after explanations about how NXT just provides platform with which BTCD is built over and has nothing to do with original NXT developers or the currency itself.<br /><br />The situation escalated after an argument with the web designer after which this individual threatened me that he &quot;could just hit ctrl alt delete and walk away&quot;, and said that he had done so on the past to another coin.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Regarding the pre-mine, should we have been more transparent in the beginning.&nbsp; The short answer: Yes.&nbsp; However, I will blame myself because I only wanted to protect TorrnA and BTCDdev from any criticism who both put in a ton of work and deserve every BTCD they received from the pre-mine.<br /><br />In addition, I&#039;m not going to sit idly by while an individual attempts use threats and blackmail to achieve some sense of control and extort funds for their own gain.&nbsp; This is not in the spirit of what BTCD is all about.&nbsp; For the most part the development of BTCD has remained mostly &quot;ego&quot; free which is how we&#039;d like to keep it.&nbsp; If development team members can&#039;t agree to this, then they have no place on the development team.<br /><br />Lastly, yes, we are asking for donations.&nbsp; Donations are all being carefully recorded and held by TorrnA, who I can vouch for as a very trustworthy individual.&nbsp; All bounty payments going forward will be completely transparent and divulged to the community.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></div><br />i never blackmailed any dev i just asked for what i think my work worths so far and future developement, if someone can receive 1k BTCD for this <a class="ul" href="http://oi61.tinypic.com/33ttet0.jpg">http://oi61.tinypic.com/33ttet0.jpg</a> i think that i should get more than 0 BTCD for work done and continuig to work here, i yet asked about premine and about 2 weeks ago i was told it was kept for james but now it seems things changed and its not keept, btw the actuall premine was 1.5% from 1.6M coins that should have been in PoW<br /></div>it would be nice if you kept to the facts. I am so disappointed about this. Funds were being raised so people like yourself could be compensated. Also, I do not remember seeing any posts anywhere about the premine being kept for me! In fact, I have posted several times that the premine was mostly used before I even arrived and also that I wanted the 3500 BTCD offered to me to go to BTCDdev since he wasnt able to get much on the open market. I believe it is quite important for key contributors to be vested<br /><br />The estimated value of the BTCD that the three got from the premine is &lt;1 BTC for most of the PoW period. If anybody has any problems with this other than yourself, I would be surprised. Now it is curious to me that you are complaining about 1000 BTCD given to what looks to me like professional graphic designer. What was the value at the time? 1000 BTCD today is different than several weeks ago. If you are volunteering to work and then decide you want to become a paid contractor midstream, then this is your decision. Maybe if you had purchased BTCD on the open market when it was cheap like other key contributors (also showing faith in your own project), then some envy over somebody else getting paid would not be an issue?<br /><br />Care to explain what NXT txid 17945798072342483012 is?<br /><br />I had sent you 500 NXTprivacy directly as confirmation of your work and while this is not the same as 1000 BTCD, it was also clear that there would be more after work was completed. Whether your work is worth more or less than what some other paid contractor is getting is a judgement call. I trust Azeh&#039;s judgement on such matters and since you cannot get over the horrible injustice that you have been subjected to, it is best that you leave. I wish you luck in the future and if you decide to keep posting here, please stay with the facts.<br /><br />Goodbye.<br /><br />James<br /></div>1k was given few days ago so its not much less, i can post skype chat logs about premine keept if you want to see, also i own more than 30k BTCD that is not sold unlike the premine so yes it gives faith here a lot, as for that asset please send me your NXT address and i will return it same second, its not any value for me receiving your assets which it seems you have one for every feature for this coin that is to be released, well maybe, as yet still no sign of anything<br /><br />EDIT: i never asked for the free asset, but it seems i received it when i questioned the NXT benefits from your work here<br /></div>please send the NXTprivacy to the donation pool address. I dont know what it is, maybe Azeh does<br /><br />Also, i think you have things a bit twisted around. I have been working on my assets for all this year, which represents many manyears of ordinary coders and I am putting them inside BTCD and sharing revenues. Since you do not like this, I can make it so your 30K BTCD dont get these dividends. Is that your preference?<br /><br />Have you seen MGW? It is already one of the top exchanges by daily trading volumes. <br /><br />Please if you want to start some FUD, just sell all your BTCD now. many were expecting it to drop to .005 and since we are retesting .007 the only way that will happen is for some WH to dump.<br /><br />To have 2.5% of BTCD and to be acting so petty and jealous over 1000BTCD?<br /><br />You cannot at the same time be acting the way you are and still expecting BTCD to go up in price. Please dump your BTCD, we want lower prices. <br /><br />James<br /></div>Never said i dump BTCD or i will FUD i really wish all the best for this coin, its not jealousy over that 1k its just there were other members that were far far better than the one thet received payment, and was the only one to receive, but on the other side they are not all friends with the devs so they share with them, i will send to dev fund when azeh gives me address not a problem at all, and yes i don&#039;t want dividends from whatever that is i like the coin like it is so i will just keep steaking and avoid being part of something more that i find fishy<br /></div><br />This is the last time i&#039;ll address this issue, because i&#039;ve basically said everything i&#039;ve had to say. &nbsp;Except that I conveniently forgot to mention that you received nxtprivacy as compensation, so yet you set yourself up for that one.<br /><br />However, you continue to have a disregard for facts. &nbsp;It had nothing to do with him being BTCDdev&#039;s friend because this was my call. &nbsp;I paid him 1000 BTCD of my personal funds.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;d kindly ask everyone to get back on topic and not let this thread devolve into a petty quarrel. <br /><br />IceColdTommy, if you want to continue to contribute and add value to the thread then go right ahead. &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;d also call on others to not be baited into this argument any longer. Members can already glean the information from what has been said before and make their own judgments<br /></div>if you used your private funds, then this matter is totally closed. What right does anybody have to tell you how to spend your money? Nobody. It is your money, that is why it is called &quot;your money&quot;!<br /><br />This is my last post on this, barring some factual error that might be posted in future that needs to be corrected<br /><br />James</div>

Of course, at first it will be the jl777 friendly command line via debug console, but we can debug things and then when longzai has GUI, it becomes easy to use for everyone.<br /><br />I apologize for the delays, but along the way we got M of N (254) fragments, MGW support ahead of schedule and some additional think time for me to keep improving Teleport. As soon as we get positive test results for teleporting BTCD, I will work on adding BTC and NXT teleporting. The former will be much faster than the latter. I think around this time, we will see GUI, so maybe we are still not so far from original goal of end of month releasing<br /><br />James<br /><br /></div>

I am so disappointed about this. Funds were being raised so people like yourself could be compensated. Also, I do not remember seeing any posts anywhere about the premine being kept for me! In fact, I have posted several times that the premine was mostly used before I even arrived and also that I wanted the 3500 BTCD offered to me to go to BTCDdev since he wasnt able to get much on the open market. I believe it is quite important for key contributors to be vested<br /><br />The estimated value of the BTCD that the three got from the premine is &lt;1 BTC for most of the PoW period. If anybody has any problems with this other than yourself, I would be surprised. Now it is curious to me that you are complaining about 1000 BTCD given to what looks to me like professional graphic designer. What was the value at the time? 1000 BTCD today is different than several weeks ago. If you are volunteering to work and then decide you want to become a paid contractor midstream, then this is your decision. Maybe if you had purchased BTCD on the open market when it was cheap like other key contributors (also showing faith in your own project), then some envy over somebody else getting paid would not be an issue?<br /><br />Care to explain what NXT txid 17945798072342483012 is?<br /><br />I had sent you 500 NXTprivacy directly as confirmation of your work and while this is not the same as 1000 BTCD, it was also clear that there would be more after work was completed. Whether your work is worth more or less than what some other paid contractor is getting is a judgement call. I trust Azeh&#039;s judgement on such matters and since you cannot get over the horrible injustice that you have been subjected to, it is best that you leave. I wish you luck in the future and if you decide to keep posting here, please stay with the facts.<br /><br />Goodbye.<br /><br />James<br /></div>1k was given few days ago so its not much less, i can post skype chat logs about premine keept if you want to see, also i own more than 30k BTCD that is not sold unlike the premine so yes it gives faith here a lot, as for that asset please send me your NXT address and i will return it same second, its not any value for me receiving your assets which it seems you have one for every feature for this coin that is to be released, well maybe, as yet still no sign of anything<br /><br />EDIT: i never asked for the free asset, but it seems i received it when i questioned the NXT benefits from your work here<br /></div>please send the NXTprivacy to the donation pool address. I dont know what it is, maybe Azeh does<br /><br />Also, i think you have things a bit twisted around. I have been working on my assets for all this year, which represents many manyears of ordinary coders and I am putting them inside BTCD and sharing revenues. Since you do not like this, I can make it so your 30K BTCD dont get these dividends. Is that your preference?<br /><br />Have you seen MGW? It is already one of the top exchanges by daily trading volumes. <br /><br />Please if you want to start some FUD, just sell all your BTCD now. many were expecting it to drop to .005 and since we are retesting .007 the only way that will happen is for some WH to dump.<br /><br />To have 2.5% of BTCD and to be acting so petty and jealous over 1000BTCD?<br /><br />You cannot at the same time be acting the way you are and still expecting BTCD to go up in price. Please dump your BTCD, we want lower prices. <br /><br />James</div>

And thank you for all your hard work &amp; community spirit. Read black paper and all threads. Bought a nice starting stack of BTCD just as we were lifting off a few days ago. I&#039;m a long-term holder. Can you point me to the most challenging (=negative) analysis - written by credible devs/investors - to your approach and tech? What are the big concerns/limitations etc?<br /></div>People have been trying to solve the wrong problem and since Teleport solves the right problem, the big criticism is that I am not solving the wrong problem of making a new crypto algo that is anon. The right problem is how to create a way to use crypto that maintains privacy. This is what I solved, I didnt bother to make any new cryptographic maths as there already existed all that was needed.<br /><br />It is like there is this giant effort of people who all go off to far and distant places in search of the answer and I just go to the train station where they all left from and find the answer right there! Maybe this makes some peoples angry at me, but I dont care I just want to have nice way of making crypto private and I am lazy to make difficult stuff. I just use what I find, here, there, put them together.<br /><br />I am still waiting for any actual criticism of Teleport that I am not aware of. The creation/extraction is definitely a concern and we must take great precautions there. We are actively searching to hire a credible dev to do a thorough code review. Of course, if anybody has found any flaws in the DarkPaper, I am hoping they will post so we can address it. If there are no flaws in the overall design and the code implements to that design, then it seems Teleport is nice and solid.<br /><br />I am iterative coding style, so over time the code improves by using new algorithms if necessary. I dont believe any wholesale changes are needed to the basic design, but I am always making mistakes, so if it is needed, then I just write more code to fix it. Whatever issues are found by code reviewer, I will fix them of course.<br /><br />So, if anybody knows a credible coder who can do a meaningful review of Teleport, PLEASE contact them. We need this as without it people will just have to trust me, and there is no need for this trustpoint as the source is open, we just need to get a peer review. We will pay reasonable fee for the time spent.<br /><br />James<br /></div><br />Thank you. Fair response. I hope indeed you have had the simple breakthrough idea that we have been waiting for. The tech/code is beyond me to assess, but I am always drawn by the elegant solution to difficult problems. Let&#039;s find those peers and get some reviews going - and see what the world says.<br /><br />Edit: James, just saw your post asking for help in Risto&#039;s altcoin thread. Great! I hope someone picks up the challenge.<br /></div>I thought that was an active thread, but almost 12 hours since my post and not a single new one? <br />also, the Teleport concept might be simple enough for pirates, it turns out the implementation is quite involved and I had to port over vast majority of MGW code, just for one subset of Teleport. Probably ends up be 20,000 lines of code not counting all the libraries, so simple concept but lots of details<br /><br />James</div>
