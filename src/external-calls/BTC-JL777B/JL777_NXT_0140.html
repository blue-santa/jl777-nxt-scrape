Got it.<br /></div>This is crypto, so yes if you are posting your privkey publicly and you have funds in it, guaranteed it will be taken.<br /><br />This is a case that is of similar nature, but maybe it was meant as a way to reward the original notaries. All we can go by is what is in the code. I guess now you make it clear you feel the KMD notaries are somehow at fault for your dev copy and pasting their pubkeys.<br /><br />If the crypto isnt secure, then what is the point for it? If you cant make a secure crypto, dont go crying that it isnt secure. And considering the hostility your community exhibits towards all this, it is not any wonder that the KMD notaries dont feel much need to be compassionate for your $50 dollars of lost mining revenues.<br /><br /></div>

Let them do whatever they want, let them do DEX. Most people here understand where that premine will go from the non-greedy devs who still have no lambo. Just don&#039;t waist your time on that nonsense.<br /></div>When I am personally attacked, I take it personally. But you are right, SAFE is not anything I should be wasting time on.<br /><br />However, the policy on how KMD will deal with forks is something I feel I should at least have some ideas on. Until there was the first fork, it was not anything real so was hard to get tangible policy. <br /><br />The danger of allowing incomplete forks to pretend they are complete is that when they fail, it will reflect badly on KMD. As such, if a fork is not technically worthy, I feel it is our duty to demonstrate this in a non-harmful way. I do not consider the loss of $1000 of mining revenue as any material harm and that is my estimate for the delayed blocks due to the diff increase. All this whining and screaming and personal attacks are from about $1000 of lost revenues, or more like delayed revenues. If the miners just stopped mining when the diff goes too high, the losses would be in the hundreds of dollars, but I will assume that they were not so good at cost management.<br /><br />The security of the chain must come first, so if there are known vulnerabilities a tough love approach will be used. Anybody is free to fork KMD and ask for advice on how best to do this, we received no such requests from SAFE, who brazenly makes a plain copy paste and releases a broken clone. As soon as I found out it was broken, I advised them on how to fix it. So far this advice is mostly ignored and the SAFE chain is still unsafe.<br /><br />Also, what is disturbing is their community&#039;s total lack of hesitation to rollback the chain. For 60,000 SAFE as compared to the 4 million premine, they almost unanimously voted to rollback the chain and even now I hear they are working to take away the properly notary mined coins. I dont know about you, but to not be willing to allow the creator of the coin that was forked to retain 1% of the coins for finding a big flaw, while letting the copy paster keep 4 million in the premine and millions more in stealth mined coins, just seems quite hyprocritical. It seems that all the SAFE community cares about is mining coins for cheap to not let anybody else get any coins, even if done according to the coin&#039;s consensus rules. Of course each coin is free to do what it wants, but if they are acting this way, I feel it should be pointed out that there is no value placed on the security of coins, no any sense of owing the parent coin anything at all.<br /><br />So, in the case of such reactions and motivations, then I dont feel there is any obligation on our part to be any nicer than we have to be. An honest fork would deserve to have more niceness in its treatment. The more honest the fork is, the better the treatment. Basically it would be best to not disregard your heritage and to actually hold up crypto principles, instead of just being a pure money grab.<br /><br />Now, regardless of how it is done, the idea is to determine if a fork is worthy of being able to call itself a KMD fork. It must be a complete fork of KMD if it is advertising itself as that. And if it saying it has made improvements to KMD, then that also must be demonstrated. So we will post a report card on the status as we find out about these forks. It might not be updated in a realtime fashion as you have said we have more important things to do, and the burden is on the fork to prove themselves.<br /><br />SAFE: <br />Not a full KMD fork, so far just a cut and paste with name change &quot;komodo&quot; -&gt; &quot;safecoin&quot;<br />No support for notaries<br />No notarizations<br />No protection from dPoW on BTC or any other chain. It is only protected by the very small mining done by the current miners.<br />Severe vulnerabilities to hashrate manipulation, coins emissions, compounded interest attack that have all been fixed in KMD long time ago.<br />A full code review has not been made and this fork was done without any consultation with us so there could be other implementation problems created in the name change process along with whatever other changes were made.<br />4 million premine and fast mining of 128 coins per block all for 36 million total cap, no hesitation to rollback the chain over 60,000 notary mined coins.<br /><br />From what I have seen the changes made to fix the hashrate issues will be ineffective and does not address the real security issues that they have already been notified about. I guess it is more important to prevent any notary mined coins from being used than to actually fix the coin. Until SAFE is an actual KMD fork and safe from the known attack vectors, we reserve the right to field test the new versions against the claimed fixes. It just isnt responsible to release known vulnerable code. However any coins gained from such activities will be set aside for the future development of that fork and it wont be sold off on the open market.<br /><br />Now all that being said, I do have to say that safecoin has done what no other clone coin dev has done and created a half-fork of KMD. If KMD was an ordinary coin, it would have been a perfectly fine cut and paste job. The coin ports were changed, all the usual required changes were made. So there is hope that safecoin can make SAFE into a complete fork, but this is not yet proven.&nbsp; And whether SAFE can create any direct benefit for KMD with upstream pull requests... <br /><br />To the SAFE community, this might all feel like harsh treatment and I do admit it is on the harsh side, but you did it to yourself with your behavior and constant personal attacks against me. I care about the long term values, not today&#039;s mining revenues.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

It did not even have all the height based features (bug fixes) activated.<br /><br />When notary mining was done it combined with the long ago fixed bug that didnt limit the number of blocks a notary can get. So the diff started going up. Mining was stopped when the diff was at 100 million, which is far less than the 10 billion (or trillions) the diff would have gone to. It was a high level, but nothing life threatening.<br /><br />The chain was never forked. No coins were lost. Mining was proceeding, just at a higher diff so slower. When it became clear that changes were being proposed that would create a fork, when no fork was even there in the first place, I spent hours trying to help by giving detailed instructions on how to fix it. Even after I was booted from their discord.<br /><br />However, it seems they ignored my detailed instructions on how to get their codebase to activate all the height based features/bug fixes and it seems they pushed forward with an ineffective fix to the high diff. They claim they improved dPoW, but they dont have any notarization active, so it isnt protected by notarizations. That means the longest chain rule is in effect and if they did in fact push forward with the forking change, it will likely create a pretty big mess. <br /><br />So, they claim to be a komodo fork, but really at this point it is half a fork as they dont have the fundamental dPoW implemented. I was willing to help and did spent hours trying to help, but it seems their community is all hostile at me. Now implied threats are being made at me.<br /><br />I do hope they will stop misrepresenting what they are adding, like they are claiming to be working on a DEX. I dont mind an honest fork, but when the claimed improvement to dPoW is to have cut and pasted all the KMD notaries, there is a clear disconnect between the claims and reality.<br /><br />Also there is past history here where safecoin initially didnt even acknowledge it used forked komodo code. I had to complain to them about that. Now they claimed they improved on dPoW and are working on a DEX, when so far it is just a copy paste with string changes.<br /><br />You mean that story?<br /><br />Dont do a halfway fork (literally) and claim to have made improvements. SAFE has a lot of vulnerabilities as it is basically very early KMD during the testnet days as dPoW was being debugged. All the KMD height specific triggers for activations were just copied.<br /><br />So in the current state SAFE is not a full KMD fork and if you dont do it properly, it is not a good thing. This was demonstrated in a way that didnt create a fork, didnt lose any coins and would have self-repaired. I do admit the prior history and the misrepresentations made did not make me feel keen to help them at first, but when they start to propose breaking a chain that isnt broken I stepped in.<br /><br />Then I am pushed out because all the miners are mad at losing several hours of mining. While there are pretty severe vulnerabilities active and exposed. Including the attack vectors that the blackhat hit KMD with early last year that are also height triggered. But the day&#039;s mining rewards are more important to the miners.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a long day, I squeezed in all that in between and after my normal busy day. If you are buying SAFE thinking it is a KMD fork, I think it is important to know the technical facts. I will let you decide what a 4 million coin premine (of 36 million) and a 128 block reward means. As far as their claims to be working on a DEX, i didnt see any code but maybe they are writing something totally from scratch. They did fork agama also, at least it looked like it.<br /><br />My problem is not with their forking, but with the misrepresentation of what they have added, along with the halfway-ness that makes it vulnerable.<br /><br />If anybody else wants to fork KMD, that is fine. You can ask for help and if you are an honest fork, I will help. If you are not, then I will call you out. I might even demonstrate that you are making false claims. If there is past history that makes me a bit upset at the second &quot;violation&quot;, then I might push a bit more than otherwise.<br /><br />That&#039;s the story. I seem to have acted a bit more emotionally than I would normally as this is a very personal issue for me. As it is now the SAFE chain can likely be killed (by many different people, even those not so skilled, as the past issues are well documented) and likely I am one of the few that can help them to fix things properly. However I do not like being made out to be some bad actor by short sighted miners and SAFE team members. SAFE chain right now is not traded anywhere, only being mined. When exactly is the right time to assess a chain&#039;s safety? All this is very complex and you cant just look at the code and know precisely what would happen, that&#039;s why they are called bugs.<br /><br />At this point I am not sure what to do and I am open to community suggestions. On the one hand it is sad that the first KMD fork is in the state it is in and I would like to have it use code and bugfixes over the last 1.5 years. On the other hand I am pretty busy and considering their past behavior and the constant attacks on me for the tough love approach I took, well it is not easy to stay in the helping mood while the majority of interactions are personal attacks on my character. <br /><br /></div>

There has been tons of development since then. Including ETH/ERC20 integration into BarterDEX. <br /><br /></div><br />The thing is that until they conduct their so-called &quot;first dICO&quot; there ethereum DAICO will be already conducted by Abyss. They claimed to conduct the first dICO back in a day and failed to even start it. I think they shouldn&#039;t call it FIRST anymore. I know also first decentralized ICO which wasn&#039;t hyped and they didn&#039;t claim to be first dICO but they did it already, Zen Protocol.<br /></div>ZEN protocol used atomic swaps to conduct a dICO? That&#039;s news to me<br /></div>
