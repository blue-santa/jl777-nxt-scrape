With small markets, just knowing there is a big buy moves the market. So the bot with patiently wait for the right price, make small volume bids, but 24/7 until your high level order is filled.<br /><br />I think this would be quite useful for people too busy to personally trade the markets<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />These tradebots would be <strong>one of the best features</strong> to be implemented, not for traders but for people who see NXT as <strong>long term</strong> investment (these times, it looks like speculation&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" />). It is the same as suppression of part of the orderbook; orderbooks have been, and still are, abused by HFT; plain standard players look at the orderbook, put their orders in it, and millisecond after that, the orders the guy has been counting on to do his trade just vanish, like a mirage... <br /><br />Some questions though :<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>about <strong>confidentiality</strong> of the data that stays in the tradebot</li><li>is there something like an <strong>early description</strong>, and may be a release date for it ?</li><li>how can we solve the <strong>cash only</strong> problem in point 2</li></ul></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the tradebot is local to your node, so unless you share it with someone or get hacked, nobody else will know your instructions to the tradebot<br />I am also going to make a framework for tradebot writers to be able to publish profit making bots for investors to use and they will share profits, no profits, not payments.<br /><br />I have the Turing complete scripting language done, it is called &quot;C&quot;, a few millions of coders exist for this language and I was just adding external libraries for it when Teleport idea came to me, I have some few specifications in NXTcoinsco/Tradebots thread, but the best place to follow this would be in the BTCD thread <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=684090.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=684090.0</a><br /><br />Teleport solves the anon problem and your assumption that current crypto is anonymous is incorrect, current crypto is totally transparent. The tradebots will be able to trade privately.<br /><br />I am close to releasing Teleport functionality into testing and NXT will be bundled with every installation of BTCD. I made recommendation to get some when it was less than 5% current price, and with less than $3 mil marketcap, there is still a lot of rapid price gains possible in the medium term, if I get the tech done<br /><br />James

					sharkfund0 gains 50% in 3 months<br />current bid 15000 NXT, ask 16000 NXT<br /><br />Not to toot my own horn, well ok I am doing exactly that <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />many said that no NXT asset could outperform NXT itself, I have maintained that NXT based assets should act as leveraged NXT and hedged assets like sharkfund0 could make steady gains as NXT price fluctuates.<br /><br />Theories are theories and it is only after three months and despite going a below 9000 NXT (from starting price of 10000 NXT) when NXT had peaked at .00016 BTC, as NXT has dropped below the price when sharkfund0 started (.00007 BTC), the true gains of sharkfund0 is apparent. Granted when NXT goes from .00006 where it is now to .00007, then the half that is not in NXT would need to gain 16% just to maintain the current price. With BTCD being most of that other half, the question is whether BTCD will be at .005 when NXT gets to .00007<br /><br />In any case, if people are going to complain when it is at 9000 NXT (even though it had gained a lot in BTC or USD terms), then I should be able to be proud that it is at 15000+ even with the boost from the slightly lower NXT price.<br /><br />I am pretty sure that sharkfund0 has made the most amount for its purchasers than any other asset, with cumulative profits of around 7 million NXT, or over $200K USD. It is quite possible that sharkfund0 has made more liquid gains than ALL other assets combined. Not sure about that claim, just not aware of any other assets with anything close to 7 million NXT of profits. Not bad for three months, when NXT itself is down 15%. One important note is that this is not paper profits, but liquid as there has always been a bid that was plenty big for anybody that wanted to sell.<br /><br />The future of sharkfund0 is highly dependent on Teleport as it has been morphed into a one stop purchase that benefits more the better the Teleport system does. At 16000 NXT it seems expensive, but you can buy as little as .0001 sharkfund0 for 1.6 NXT so anybody can get the same returns as the big whales that bought big chunks of sharkfund0<br /><br />James

I didnt count all the little coins in the portfolio, they arent worth so much, but the actually value is fractionally more, so I will put the bid/ask asymmetrically around this price. Due to the volatility and the fact I am not monitoring the price so often the spread will be 15000/16000<br /><br />The portfolio is now pretty set and cant really change much, so feel free to make a tracker and make a market in sharkfund0<br /><br />James

You have your theories bter was in on this heist, I have some direct and indirect knowledge that indicates with very high probability that they were not.<br /><br />the verifiable facts are:<br />1. 51 million NXT was transferred from bter acct to an acct controlled by thesir<br />2. bter paid out hundreds of btc, thesir sent back all but 8 million NXT<br />3. bter started with 3% withdraw fee<br />4. bter is lowering it to 1%<br /><br />I think we can agree on these facts. Let us avoid debate over things we cannot prove. bter is a substantial company and I doubt they will go broke over 8 million NXT, though their working capital is already depleted so they are probably operating without much of a buffer. So 1% fee on 50 million is 500,000 NXT. Is that really so egregious? Is that really such a horrible thing? Why not demand that dgex lower their fees to 0.5% too?<br /><br />Remember bter helped recover a lot of the klee heist funds and without them it is likely the InfCom fund would be zeroed out. So, dont the deserve some credit for that? how about a 15% reward for collecting the InfCom fund?<br /><br />Please lighten up. The bottom line is that people will be getting back 99%+ of their bter funds. That is certainly near the absolute best case scenarios I can think of for where this was at this weekend. they could have just not paid thesir any BTC and he would probably not have returned any NXT. In that case bter would have not had any option but to default on NXT deposits, probably lost a lot of their business, but maybe they could have survived. I believe it is their sense of honor that made them pay the BTC so they could get as close to fixing this as possible.<br /><br />1% fee is what you are complaining about? Did bter even ask for any reward for recovering the InfCom funds? Get dgex to lower withdraw fees to 0.5%, then we can ask bter to match<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. on a lighter note I am thinking of implementing trustlines into telepod transfers. Isnt that great!

You put up $200 worth of BTSX as collateral and receive a $100 loan of bitUSD in return. You can't touch that collateral until you repay the loan, and if prices change such that your collateral falls below some margin threshhold, the DAC executes a margin call and repays your loan with your collateral. So every loan is always fully backed by BTSX. In your example, you were imagining that bitUSD is some kind of leveraged USD; it's the other way around!<br /><br />So you see the collateral requirements are <em>extremely</em> conservative. Why would I put up $200 to borrow $100, you ask? So that I can sell the bitUSD, hoping BTSX will appreciate relative to USD. Then in the future, I buy back the (now cheaper) bitUSD, repay my loan, and there's my profit. BitUSD allows you to short USD relative to BitsharesX.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Can you explain what will happen if a whale or group of whales all short the bitUSD at the same time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Let's say I'm a whale: I put up all my BTSX as collateral and short bitUSD, flooding the market with bitUSD. As a result, the price of bitUSD temporarily plunges way below that of USD. Hundreds of opportunistic traders rush in to buy the bitUSD at a discount, <strong>knowing that the price will rise back to that of USD.</strong> Of course, this causes the price of bitUSD to rise, which could re-establish the bitUSD/USD peg all by itself.<br /><br />However, simultaneously, other traders fear that the peg is failing, so they rush out and convert BTSX to &quot;real&quot; USD, which decreases the value of BTSX relative to USD. Note that this is the <em>opposite</em> direction that the whale thought the price would go! So the whale's strategy has worked against him, and if the real USD price of BTSX falls too much, the network will execute a margin call, confiscating his BTSX collateral and using it to repurchase all the BitUSD he originally shorted. Thus, in the end, the loan is repaid and the whale is beached without a dime to his name.<br /><br />I've left out some implementation details, specifically that the market price at which someone is allowed to short is not naively the last price or anything like that; I mean it's a moving average of market prices over some time period. I don't know these exact details, but there are quite a few &quot;safety&quot; features built into it to prevent really destructive attacks.<br /><br />At least I hope so...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see the bold part is an assumption. You are basically saying that if everyone believe 1bitUSD=1USD, then 1bitUSD=1USD. Try replacing USD with 10USD or 0.1USD in your argument, can you point out what's the difference from your original argument?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually they can manipulate 1 bitUSD = 1USD with pairing bitusd/btsx and btsx/USD, where whales manipulate either to keep bitusd stronger and weakening USD, or Making USD stronger, weakening bitUSD. Either case, you need a group of strong whales to do this. So yeah in principles it can be done.&nbsp; Please correct me if i am wrong.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>basically as soon as btsx drops 50% this whole thing collapses, but crypto never drops 50% from its alltime high does it?<br />when the collateral is highly volatile crypto, it is a matter of time before there is not enough collateral, this causes a run on deposits, which probably causes the price to drop more. Sounds like an unstoppable implosion feedback loop, until it reaches a price so low that bottom fishers are willing to toss a few BTC to buy at 10% of original price<br /><br />Of course I could be totally wrong and this could be as stable as the USD<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oTKJ5Rh7Kxg/UDNbGREczfI/AAAAAAAAAqk/LumGFzSWm50/s1600/Monetary+Base.png" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oTKJ5Rh7Kxg/UDNbGREczfI/AAAAAAAAAqk/LumGFzSWm50/s1600/Monetary+Base.png</a><br /><br />dont worry USD is totally fine, nothing can go wrong, nothing can go wrong, nothing can go wrong, ...<br /><br />James

I've taken the time to learn the mechanics bitassets and I'm very impressed, it's a beautiful solution to a standing problem, mechanically sound, aligning incentives in a way that promotes accurate price discovery. <br /><br />Who knows if it will work, I'm about 50% sure it will.<br /><br />I'm probably more of a Nxt fanboy than a Bitshares disciple, but I see the HUGE potential of bitassets. Bitassets will be crypto's killer app, the entire world will play ball with a project that brings the benefits of crypto to real world assets. Anonymity within the system is a bonus of course! <br /><br />Kudos to the Bitshares crowd for working on this killer feature, you will take the fall, hard, if you fail. But you'll probably own the world with successful implementation. Nxt should be watching! Nxt should be copying! If Bitassets don't collapse during price discovery, Nxt should be hot on Bitshares heels with a similar project.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>how is any of bitshares different than NXT derivatives like shortNXT, which has been around for quite a while

Their stated intention is to pay it all back.

Probably the 3% will deter enough people from withdrawing to enable them to pay those who do withdraw. I think that's the main reason the 3% applies to NXT withdrawals and not BTC ones.<br /><br />Given that they seem to be insolvent as far as NXT are concerned, I think their main other option to prevent a run is to restrict all withdrawals. Perhaps applying for some kind of bankruptcy protection along Chapter 11 lines (or whatever the relevant law is). Do you think that would be better?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>it seems to be under control, I saw they are lowering it to 1%, which is the lowest dgex rate and half its &quot;fast&quot; withdrawal rate of 2%<br />why make things so complicated?

You put up $200 worth of BTSX as collateral and receive a $100 loan of bitUSD in return. You can't touch that collateral until you repay the loan, and if prices change such that your collateral falls below some margin threshhold, the DAC executes a margin call and repays your loan with your collateral. So every loan is always fully backed by BTSX. In your example, you were imagining that bitUSD is some kind of leveraged USD; it's the other way around!<br /><br />So you see the collateral requirements are <em>extremely</em> conservative. Why would I put up $200 to borrow $100, you ask? So that I can sell the bitUSD, hoping BTSX will appreciate relative to USD. Then in the future, I buy back the (now cheaper) bitUSD, repay my loan, and there's my profit. BitUSD allows you to short USD relative to BitsharesX.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I thought it was pegged to USD, so how could it appreciate?<br />unless you are saying this is just a 50% margin to speculate on bitsharesX value? so while it is going up, people can parlay, creating more gains, which can be parlayed, again, etc. Theoretically this could keep going up forever, all the way to the moon.<br /><br />except at some point it cant.<br /><br />then it goes the other way, so really what has happened is to create extreme volatility. This is good since crypto is so boring and stable, like watching short term interest rates in realtime. With this leverage, we get a constant rollercoaster giving day traders a perfect vehicle for fun<br /><br />James
