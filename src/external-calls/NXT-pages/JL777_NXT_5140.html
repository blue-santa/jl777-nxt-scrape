					Another day, another big event in cryptoland. Never boring, thats for sure!<br />ripple's founder is selling 9 billion XRP, thats more than all the XRP ever given away or sold and orders of magnitude more than the daily trading volume of XRP.<br />Unfortunately I had a bunch of XRP from my mining days in my personal acct. Liquitated it all, as this is a fundamental change and will force ripplelabs to deplete their capital base to privately purchase the XRP. Anything else leads to the end of XRP.<br />corporations being what they are usually find a way to survive, so lets assume there is a private sale.<br />ripplelabs has increased headcount significantly and they have a large burn rate so with an unexpected capital depletion, I expect the brighter employees to start job hunting<br />within a few months the only people left developing ripple tech will be the ones that nobody else wanted to hire<br />also, nobody develops ripple stuff unless it is their 9to5 job.<br /><br />From NXT perspective, this is another potential rival that is in the emunie category, eg. not a factor anymore. When etherium announces delays in getting their system deployed due to unforseen bugs, it will give NXT that much more time to solidify its place as the only second gen game in town. Well,ok, there is XCP and mastercoin, but they are on a 10 minute clock.<br /><br />Who here who has used AE would like to switch to the bitcoin blockchain? Anybody? come one average of 10 minutes and the occasional one hour delay, how bad could that be? A showstopper you say? I think the slow blockchain is fine for selling stuff like real estate, and non-time sensitive items.<br /><br />With the 51% LTC pool, the market is shifting out of the pure clones to enhanced clones, like DRK, but even sleepers like ANC is up +20% today, along with XCP +24% and MRO seems to have found the bottom. Coincidentally right about where I got back in. So the major altholdings of sharkfund are up across the board, but this type of change goes up one day, down the other day. Nothing to get too excited over<br /><br />Nothing for the shark to do today, so he will go back to sleep and let James do some coding<br /><br />The Shark<br /><br />

They in turn &quot;flooded&quot;the market and destroyed the price from 15 XRP per USD to 150. I think this got Jed upset and he decided to show them what flood means. I estimate less than 1 billion XRP has been sold to the partners over six months. Imagine 10 times that at the same time. <br /><br />James

No.<br />The price of NXT is based on a fraction of a fraction of a fraction being used / traded. Not at all representative.<br /><br />That is what worries me most and that is what you see happening over and over: price rises, 500k dump, price rises some more, 500k dump, price dwindles. There is to little liquidity to sustain the massive amounts of NXT some people have.<br /><br />A part will also be caused by the IPO's on AE. A &quot;company&quot; raises 1-2 miljoen NXT and somewhere down the line they have to convert to BTC and / or fiat (to pay for expenses) and so have a pressure effect on the price as well.<br /><br />I have no idea how to solve this, but it is a concern to me and I understand why people keep bringing this up (in the meantime I have a fun time with everything being developed&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /> ).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>We just need a lot more active users. Also the fact that the price is relatively stable is not so bad. It is like big glacier during the transition from Ice Age. As time goes by, the big chunks break off and dissolve and eventually no more glacier<br /><br />Just need a little longer term perspective to see the fundamental trends in place<br />Though not as long as changing from Ice Age <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />Something like several years. I know it sounds long, but look at BTC 6 months after it was created. several years makes a big difference.<br /><br />James

I expect this will happen to the ripple gateway providers in a few years and the current 0.2% fee that is charged each time you even transfer a bitstamp asset (not just trade) could go to 1% or more<br /><br />just say no to taxes

The discussion seems to have grown from one on how to display assets to how to validate assets and ensure they are legit. This second question has aspects that go way beyond the display issue. This seems like a difficult problem with any distributed exchange, and it seems that ultimately it's a problem of verifying accounts (i.e. associating them with real-world users) and the difficulties that creates for the task of measuring the actual trade levels of an asset. It seems that some kind of reputation system is required; but a rep system seems much more difficult to have for Nxt than for, say eBay. The issue is that any individual can easily create an unlimited number of accounts, thereby creating an inflated image of an asset's trade volume, trade frequency, positive reputation feedbacks, or just about anything. <br /><br />The only solution to this problem I think can work is the use of stake to weigh the feedback coming from an account (again, the fairness issue. Well, life isn't fair). <strong>But even this could be gamed, since one can create a new account, move one's Nxt to the new account, and give multiple feedbacks backed by high stakes in this way</strong>. Don't know, but this seems like an important issue with no easy/simple fix.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><strong>not if you score the stake including the account creation time + maturity of the stake. there are serveral key values you can check.<br />the data is there, the hard part is to find the best working weighting combination.</strong> but as said, there is no 100%&nbsp; but you can come<br />close to it. personally i wouldn't trust any 'human' created list. latest with volume this leads into trouble. pure math and the blockchain<br />could solve this. best would be a transparant scoring algo, easy to understand and to reproduce, adjusted to it's needs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yep it seems that would be key data in verifying stake for these purposes. I think a solution like this would allow for a higher degree of decentralization than any man-made lists.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you did a path (graph) analysis of the accounts of all the assetholders, you can get a pretty good idea of how many independent asset owners there are. Basically the distance of the NXT that was used to purchase the asset from all the other purchases creates an N-dimensional vector. Ideally you would calculate an N-dimensional distance but the approximation calculated sqrt(sum(Di * Di)) will probably be a decent enough metric. Di is the NXT distance<br /><br />So the tricky part is calculating the NXT distance between two payments. Too tired now to think this through but it feels like it should definitely be possible to automatically calculate relevance metric based on the number of independent asset holders.<br /><br />Increase the relevance further by weighing the accts by how much NXT they have and it becomes super difficult to game.<br /><br />James

Like trying to prevent people from going to color TV from B+W, or from VCR to DVD, etc.<br />People like the newest tech, even the so-called normal people. What is more high-tech than an entirely new way of dealing with money, commerce, jobs, etc.?<br />It was relatively easy for me to sell all my fiat assets and convert to crypto economy, but more and more people are making this leap. Once all the necessities are available via crypto, then what stops a person from &quot;disappearing&quot; into the crypto economy? All they need is a skill that is useful inside crypto, then they earn crypto, spend crypto all with minimal govt intervention.<br />the govts will only be able to enforce taxation at the fiat &lt;-&gt; crypto conversion point. Soon, anything else will become impractical.<br />So NXT &lt;-&gt; fiat that goes to a Visa/Mastercard will allow crypto citizens to get real world cash via bankomat anytime they need it. Most of the time though the things of real value are all inside the NXT economy<br /><br />James
