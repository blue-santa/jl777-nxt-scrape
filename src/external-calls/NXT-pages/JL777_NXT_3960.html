He's traded a few times in Cryptsy or Mintpal and is curious about this whole thing. <strong>B</strong> is a Nxt veteran who promptly tries to answer all of his questions (without going into GUI/software workflows, and assuming MGW can already work with custom user Nxt accounts):<br /><br /><hr /><br /><strong>A: So, what does this &quot;Multigateway&quot; do?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>It allows you to move your Bitcoins in and out of the Nxt Asset Exchange. It also works with Litecoins, and soon it may also work with other cryptocurrencies.</em><br /><strong>A: I heard about the Asset Exchange. What makes it specially interesting?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>The Nxt Asset Exchange is a peer-to-peer marketplace to buy and sell digital assets. It works inside of the Nxt network. This means buyers and sellers can interact directly, no middlemen involved. They only need to run the Nxt software.</em><br /><strong>A: And what are &quot;digital assets&quot;? How does the Asset Exchange work?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>Digital assets can be many different things. An asset can represent shares of a company, stakes of a digital coin, tokens that you can exchange for a service, or even for physical goods... Users trade those assets in a similar way as users trade in your regular cryptocurrency exchange. An important difference is that, in your traditional exchange, the reference currency is usually Bitcoin, or whatever currency the exchange decides - while in the Asset Exchange, the reference currency is NXT.</em><br /><strong>A: So in order to trade in the Asset Exchange I have no choice but to first go somewhere and buy NXT.</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>You could do that, but Multigateway allows you to turn your Bitcoins into Bitcoin assets in your Nxt account. Then you can trade them in the Nxt Asset Exchange directly, and save steps and trading fees. In the Asset Exchange you can sell your Bitcoin assets for NXT if you want, and you can send and receive them fast because of the higher speed of the Nxt network. And whenever you want to put them back in your Bitcoin wallet, or to send them somewhere outside of the Asset Exchange, you can just do a withdrawal.</em><br /><strong>A: I see. Now this looks like the exchange I use, but I also can send coins or assets directly to other people, and there are no trading fees involved. Where's the catch? There must be some type of fee to use this.</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>There's not really a catch. You do have to pay the minimum Nxt fee every time you do a transaction in the Nxt network, and that includes the Asset Exchange. But it's a small fee and can be the same regardless of the amount in the transaction.</em><br /><strong>A: Ok, this sounds cool and I might be interested in trading there a couple bitcoins I have sleeping in my regular exchange account. How can I use this Multigateway to do that?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>Well, you need to open a Nxt account if you don't have one, and then use the Multigateway software to transfer your bitcoins into bitcoin assets. You send your bitcoins to your Multigateway Bitcoin deposit address, and Multigateway delivers the corresponding amount of Bitcoin assets in your Nxt account.</em><br /><strong>A: That I figured. But how does the system work? Does this mean I am depositing my bitcoins in a Multigateway wallet?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>Yes. Every bitcoin asset in the Asset Exchange equals one bitcoin deposited in the Multigateway.</em><br /><strong>A: I thought you said &quot;no middlemen involved&quot;. Where is this Multigateway wallet stored?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>This wallet is stored in the Multigateway servers. And...</em><br /><strong>A: Wait, but isn't that unsafe? It doesn't sound as different as a centralized exchange. What if a hacker breaks into the wallet and steals everyone's bitcoins? What if...</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>...stop there. This storage wallet is not a regular wallet. It's a multisignature wallet.</em><br /><strong>A: What's that?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>You know that, for every bitcoin address for instance, there is a private key. That private key is saved to your wallet, and is required to access the bitcoins in that address. Correct?</em><br /><strong>A: Correct.</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>That private key is like the signature to access a bank account. And a multisignature address requires more than one single signature to be operated. </em><br /><strong>A: Ok, so?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>So it works similar to a joint bank account. You need more than one signature to access to the funds.</em><br /><strong>A: I see where you're going, but if you could break it down for me it would be great.</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>Multigateway runs in three servers that have joint custody of a multisignature bitcoin address. And every server has a signature. In this case, it's what you'd call a 2-of-3 address. This means that, in order to operate with the wallet, you need at least 2 of the 3 co-signants to agree. That is, at least two of the three servers. <br />This brings two important advantages over the traditional centralized exchange server. First, if one of the three servers goes offline for some reason, the service still works because it only needs two servers to operate with the bitcoins. And most specially, since in order to access the bitcoins you'd need two of the signatures, a hacker would need to compromise two servers at the same time, which is even more difficult (much more difficult) than compromising one. So the bitcoins are pretty safe there.</em><br /><strong>A: And what if the guys running the servers dedice to gang up together and steal the bitcoins?</strong><br /><strong>B:</strong> <em>At this moment, no solution is completely trustless. This solution might be as trustless as it gets, but I'm sure James can give a better answer to this than me.</em><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>good dialogue<br />some details not 100% correct, but close enough for this sort of thing<br /><br />Even though it is 2 of 3 multisig, all three MGW servers have to achieve consensus before a pair of them will co-sign the withdraw. So, while one is down, no withdraws. Now deposits work the other way and so it just passes through, so two thirds of deposits will work fine with one MGW server offline<br /><br />I wrote some probability math on the odds of hack incident and also of collusion, but cant remember where. It is much more reliable than a centralized server, a lot more than two or three times.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. speaking of one server down, in my upgrading frustration I had rebooted my pc, but I forgot I had one of the server's NXT core's running without being detached in the console. So, this killed the NXT core on one of the MGW servers. Bringing it back online now, almost caught up. Now I belive all three MGW servers are decoupled from my pc, so should keep running regardless of my isp

Every single node has to do the second type of validation - if an AT processing node tells me &quot;as a result of this script, subtract 10 Nxt from account A and add 100 Nxt to account B&quot;, I have to reject this because if violates our business logic that Nxt cannot be created from nothing. However, if one AT processing node tells me &quot;subtract 10 Nxt from A, add 5 to B and 5 to C&quot;, and another &quot;subtract 10 from A, add 2 to B and 8 to C&quot; - without actually executing the script I can't tell what the sender of the AT transaction really intended. And by blindly accepting what the AT processing node tells me, I see a way for rogue nodes to easily create forks and break the network.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This goes a bit against the philosophy of AT, but what about not thinking of AT as a general purpose system, but rather an efficient way of creating nxt core plugins?<br /><br />AT is a sandbox so the things that can be done is much more restricted than an extra java module for the core. Assuming we had a rigorous certification process, then the plugins that pass could me linked into the core.<br /><br />The above will let us add AT plugins that solve specific use cases, which is really what is important, but it wont allow an infinite number of possible AT scripts to be used as attack vectors<br /><br />@ciyam i hope you can agree to something like this as with the GLEFU incident fresh it is clear that any small thing can cause big issues. As we get experience with AT plugins there could be a time where it is opened up more, but as a first step i propose this compromise. Anyway i have to say i am impressed with your methodical approach and i am imagining many useful plugins to enhance the core<br /><br />@jean-luc will you allow testnet usage of validated AT plugins? Granted things could blowup the testnet for a while, but that is what it is there for and by limiting it to specific plugins it reduces from an infinite test case thing to finite<br /><br />We dont need to solve all the problems at once. I hope we can come up with a compromise plan, doesnt have to be what i suggested, i just want new cool features for nxt<br /><br />James

I am just curious to see what changes you make.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I've had&nbsp; a pretty crazy week and have been lax on this.<br />Keep in mind the relative weights change as much as a function of NXT/BTC changing as anything else<br />last I checked it was ~600 BTC and ~12 million NXT<br />ah but the BTC number includes some NXT at the exchanges as I use the estimated BTC value from the exchange when I am short on time, so about 200 BTC of the 600 BTC is NXT, I guess that puts it at ~400BTC and ~14 million NXT<br /><br />Only been able to snipe littles bits and pieces here and there, nothing big to report, though I did pick up about 1000 DRK at its low for the day of .016<br />I did also snag some NXT at .0001 during the GLEFU panic sell <br />The problem with a nearly 20 million NXT fund is that 100000 NXT gain which would normally be a really great gain is 0.5%, still a nice thing but gaining 100000 NXT in a trade used to feel so much more bigger<br /><br />I will try to get caught up and get better reportings next week. I do make it a point to post whenever anything significant happens, so no news means no change. I dont trade for the sake of trading. I establish positions and hold them as long as I feel it has more to gain, other than the quick in and out trades taking advantage of panic moments, but it is hard to get a lot of volume unless it is a big panic and then maybe its not such a good idea?<br /><br />The plan is that someday one or more of the coins that sharkfund0 has 1% of becomes a top 10 coin. If it is just going sideways, nothing to do but wait. I know boring, but I made a lot of money on DRK by not doing anything and I intend to repeat that pattern.<br /><br />Now that DRK is established, I am definitely waiting for the right moments to trade it based on ratios to NXT. So I really dont want to divulge exactly all the details for obvious reasons, but I dont see a problem with summary reports on overall balance. Thanks for the input<br /><br />James

I assume it was the assets were traded away by the MGW, even though they were listed. <br /><br />What if they were sold? or transferred? Wouldn't the MGW want to send them to the withdrawl account still?<br /><br />BUT on top of this, I'm confused what even happened still. <br /><br />If i had .0167 BTC in my account, and through NXTServices, I withdrew .005, .004, and .003, which then show up in my wallet, as .0048, .0038, and .0028<br /><br />So i withdrew BTC and turned it into BTC? It seemingly made a stop in my NXT account, and there is still some there..<br /><br />OR MAYBE as i think about it..<br /><br />the mgwBTC should have been around .012, and I did see a popup saying I had been transferred that amount, but since its not the amount that is there now, it must have been transferred out, <br /><br /><strong>BUT that still means i only served to move BTC through NXT back to BTC with a .0006 service fee. <br /></strong><br />and the .00467 still in the account, and listed for sale on the AE, must have come from the previous round of testing, <br /><br />check my account, <a href="http://www.nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-T74P-RV3B-5Y8G-6K4HX&amp;c=USD" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-T74P-RV3B-5Y8G-6K4HX&amp;c=USD</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>your assets are still for sale. MGW does not do any trading of assets on your (or anybody else&#039;s) behalf<br /><br />If you dont do a withdraw, MGW wont do anything! Since you have three withdraws to your phone, I think we can assume you did three withdraws. <br /><br />Since there are still assets for sale, I think we can assume those are assets you had over and above what you withdrew<br /><br />looking at <a href="http://www.mynxt.info/blockexplorer/details.php?action=ac&amp;ac=5673499510330659925" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.mynxt.info/blockexplorer/details.php?action=ac&amp;ac=5673499510330659925</a><br /><br />There are three withdraws to address: 1B2EMN2tYx4ht7mQY7qoPR5SMq74LNdssn presumably your phones address?<br /><br />there are other tx also, but if that address is your phone&#039;s address, you seemed to have done it so that is how your phone got the deposits. Since you remember putting up the assets for sale, it is safe to assume that is how they got there<br /><br />the only question is how you had any mgwBTC to put up for sale on AE, but I did manually xfer some to all the accts to match the testnet balance, maybe you had it from then.&nbsp; I could investigate more, but I dont really see any bugs here<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Can you explain the steps I would take to withdraw to my btc withdrawal account? <br /><br /><br /><br />Sent from my HTC One using Tapatalk<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>from the 127.0.0.1:7777 page use the withdraw API form<br />that is the only way to do a MGW withdrawal other than manually transfering the asset back to MGW<br />the manual transfer might or might not as if you dont have a withdraw address specified and dont put a comment in the asset xfer MGW understands, it wont know what to do<br /><br />that is why the form is the recommended way<br /><br />Asset xfer back to MGW either manually of via API form is the only way to trigger a withdraw<br /><br />Now you can sell the asset on AE and you wont have it anymore, but that has nothing to do with MGW's functioning.

					Does anybody want to buy XCP?<br />I am selling 0.45% of XCP<br /><br />Their core devs are resorting to &quot;nothing at stake&quot; type of statements against NXT confusing it with peercoin or something else. Not sure why they are getting so desperate, but it is not a good sign.<br /><br />All of the gains from the various monero, etc. is being counteracted by XCP decline.<br />I guess they might be feeling heat from NXT AE doing so much better than their exchange and bitcoin core devs calling XCP a parasite and vowed to take measures against them, well it doesnt look good.<br /><br />So I am throwing in the towel on XCP. Will XCP simply fizzle out and fade away? probably not, but if you want an example of what an egalitarian distribution does, look at XCP. The coredevs do all the work while the rest do some stuff, but mostly by companies that are trying to make a business. From what I can tell the rest of the community isnt so active in the stuff that matters.<br /><br />Could it be &quot;not enough stake&quot;? If you have 10BTC worth of a coin, how much time can you really afford to work on it? If you have 1000 BTC worth of a coin, then clearly you can spend all your time!<br /><br />So again, BCnext was correct to do the &quot;horrible&quot; IPO. Without it NXT could have a bunch of &quot;not enough stakers&quot; like XCP. Gee, what other coin could suffer from this?<br /><br />So, it has been a very rough week. I did manage to scoop up a thousand DRK at .016 but missed the big volume at that price. My guess is that soon Evan will fix the forking, but it might take a bit longer, anyway if anybody thinks getting a blockchain to converge is easy as the NEM devs.<br /><br />So asset value is just noise level different so I wont bother changing the quote.<br />With no MGW bugs to speak of, I might be able to have a weekend free of debugging!<br /><br />James<br /><br />
