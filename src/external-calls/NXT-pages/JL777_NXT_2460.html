					MGW is running as non-profit now<br /><br />Once InstantDEX is live, MGW will get revenue sharing from InstantDEX commissions and be able to pay for operating costs and even dividends to assetholders<br /><br />I cannot continue running, maintaining, customer supporting the MGW servers anymore, so as of now they will be running at dgex response times for any issues. I planned to unplug the MGW servers end of this month, but with the production servers ETA unknown, this is not a viable thing.<br /><br />My productivity has been cut by 70% due to my needing to be running the MGW servers. So, fund the production servers or not, this is your decision. But if you dont, do not rely on me to continue running MGW on my dev servers<br /><br />I gave away over half the MGW assets across the community sold all but 10% at 50% off, used what little that raised for out of pocket expenses. Now it is the time for the NXT community to take over MGW. I cannot continue my role of MGW server host, maintenance and realtime customer support.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I am unplugging from nxtforum for the weekend, all the recent issues are just preventing me from concentrating when I need to the most. If you really need to contact me, email me

					The end of the month is rapidly approaching<br />I cannot be taking time out of my day to be managing the MGW servers and to also be realtime customer support<br /><br />Starting now, the response time for MGW support will be that of dgex<br /><br />Thank you for your understanding. It is just too stressful for me to have to be worried about everybody's missing deposits and withdraws. This stress causes me to get stressed and it is affecting my coding productivity.<br /><br />Your funds will be safe, but until the production servers are running, I will only provide daily checks of MGW servers, stuck withdraws, etc. this means if an MGW server goes down, I wont even notice for a day, so all these posts that I did a deposit 7 blocks ago and its not there yet, well it will go to 100+ blocks possibly<br /><br />There is only so much I can do and my skills are quite wasted fiddling with servers and manually processing withdraws, investigating server logs, etc. I dont mind to do this, but the stress this causes me (I cannot code for 4 hrs straight anymore (let alone 12!) because somebody's withdraw might be stuck or a deposit hasnt arrived after 7 blocks)<br /><br />As it is I have to spend time to even figure out what tx is still missing, which ones fixed themselves. Why do I have to be the one to do this? Havent I done enough?<br /><br />James

It involves community, it uses existing process, it will work.<br />why do we need to try to do something that will just create controversy. <br />since NXTorganization is not wanting any referendum, why do you keep pushing for it

While I'm a relatively new and not very active community member, except some topics the community has a good common sense and it's not that uncommon to meet&amp;agree on a single point.<br /><br />Let them share their ideas, plans and we will see how the community reacts. Maybe most of the community will agree on the most part and will gladly accept the community funds to flow to their side even IF the committees doesn't agree with their plans. Maybe it will be the opposite so that most people will find their plans unrealistic despite a committee giving them the green light.<br /><br />I'm curious about their plan and would like them to have a chance. Though I'm expecting a solid roadmap from them first.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The problem is what percentage of the community would have to agree.<br />In order to rescue the unclaimed NXT, Pouncer's proposal for NO OBJECTIONS was the only thing that could be agreed upon. how confident are you in having ZERO objections.<br />to me this is not practical and it will be a total waste of time,<br />What is being proposed here is to work with the community to refine the plan, so it would be hard for the committees to not approve it, the only issues would be milestones and triggers for payments, but these are details<br /><br />So, in my judgement, any community referendum to attempt to bypass current committee rules is doomed to failure and a waste of time and energy when we can least afford it.<br /><br />We are now on a path with 90%+ success chances, why to change to 0.01%?<br /><br />

We do not intend to merge with the committees and we don't want any formal collaboration. <br /><br />The next step towards that goal is to get more members on our team so we can be sure that we will operate 24/7. The plans will be published soon so we can show you and the other members what and how we will approach our unanimous goal of pushing Nxt forward.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is good plan. Make a plan the community supports then get the committees to fund it.<br />Perfect.<br />So please tell nexern there wont be any need for some voting. I am still exhausted from the week it took just the get the 9 million NXT into the committees instead of genesis incineration. It was a very close result and the alternative was to just burn the funds.<br />

The committees are clearly not the most effective use of funds and a centralized decision making entity would make more use of these passive NXT. I am frustrated because on the one hand you are complaining about the committees, but you dont just apply for a budget from them, which is their function.<br /><br />so stop complaining about the committees, if it is anybody surprised that a committee is slow now it should not be a surprise<br />How does it feel when I am complaining about you?<br />Is this good feeling? I give to you what you are doing to others and the monthly cointropolis useless complaining<br /><br />I am saying, dont complain. Make a proposal get a half million NXT, get results, get another half million NXT<br />the money is there, yet you say there is no money and make a negative situation when it is actually no negatives<br /><br />so you make negative out of no negative, I will complain about it.

Several applications to the committees have been stuck in limbo for weeks without even getting ANY evaluation or response. Ths is one of the main driving forces behind creating the Organization. We cannot afford to just sit and wait for 3 weeks to get stuff done anymore. We've lost interested devs due to this before. And it's even worse for marketing (which is now almost deplete anyway), where you often have to make decisions within hours. Media doesn't wait 2 weeks. 2 weeks is like a year in crypto, a story that is 2 week old is a story noone cares about. If NXT wants to stay relevant in this age of 2.0 popping up daily, we have to start being A LOT more proactive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>so you are saying you dont have the patience to wait for the time the committee takes? you must have the money right now this instant, so we should grant NXTOrganization dictatorial powers to just take whatever it deems that it needs?<br />Very interesting.<br /><br />I repeat. Nobody or organization has the authority to just demand HALF the funds from the committees. Now I am aware that speed is of the essence in many cases, but what I dont understand is why you are not able to communicate with the committee members to arrange for some timely voting on your request. You did put a request in didnt you? Since you know it sometimes takes weeks I am sure you planned ahead since you are the NXTOrganization, that would be the organized thing to do. To start things with a long latency well in advance of when it is needed.<br /><br />So please show me this application from two weeks ago that is languishing. If you are not able to get the committees to vote I think I might be able to get a hold of them.<br /><br />Maybe you didnt submit any application, if that is the case this entire approach is severely wrong and I do not like it at all. So unless you did make an application and are waiting, then this appears like you are trying to work around the committee rules. I dont really like inefficient committee things, but once it is setup it is setup. No rollback of committee authority.<br /><br />You call yourself the NXTOrganization but you are trying to bypass the committees, which is part of the NXT community and derived from the unclaimed funds, so unless your NXTOrganization won some sort of binding super majority vote to get sole control over committees, then this is going against the NXT community. Now if you do setup some sort of voting to disband the committees, then I will run against the NXTOrganization.<br /><br />Let the community decide if they want the committees to continue or if they want NXTOrganization to control all the funds or if they want me to. 2/3rds supermajority needed or the current committees stay intact and everybody including the NXTOrganization must follow the rules<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Or you could just submit an application and contact the committee members. I really dont understand why you are not just doing this, are you afraid you will get rejected?
