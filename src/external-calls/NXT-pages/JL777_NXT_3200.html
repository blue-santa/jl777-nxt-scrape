Also, to place bid/ask quote on NXT AE it costs 1 NXT, another 1 NXT to cancel. With InstantDEX no cost unless an order is filled. Also, InstantDEX is dynamically making orderbooks for all asset &lt;-&gt; asset trades, including where &quot;asset&quot; is NXT. NXT AE only supports trades based in NXT.<br /><br />Now if you dont already have the data feeds setup and the signal processing algos, then those are significant advantages, not to mention the ability to be able to run a tradebot without having to deal with all the various blockchains directly. I intent to add function calls that allow some pretty cool functionality, basically the ability to programmatically invoke NXTservices functions within a tradebot.<br /><br />Remember, I only started this tradebot language this past weekend and it is just Tuesday <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think you are misunderstanding a bit...<br />InstantDEX will be maintaining arbitrary orderbooks in realtime, but it will not be automatically matching orders. This is why I ended up duplicating MT4 functions this weekend!<br /><br />I expect that each person will look at the orderbook they are interested in and then send a offer to the one with the best price. Now, the one that receives it must decide to accept it or not. Clearly in a high volume environment that InstantDEX will become, it is not practical to do this manually.

So, yes something simple could be done by monitoring the AM traffic that records the bitcoin deposits and the NXT asset transfers. So this is something totally doable outside of my horribly complicated NXTservices source base. It wont be quite the full MGW state without bitcoind access, but would certainly be much better than no monitoring at all.<br />Maybe nxtreporting.com can do it? they already monitor asset balances, so it is just monitoring coin deposit AMs<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was thinking with my uMGW operator hat on about a e.g. python script that runs on the uMGW node, monitors the NXT and the altcoin blockchains through NXT API/RPC calls available on these nodes and stops the uMGW software in case something is wrong.<br /><br />Could you outline what checks should be done?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you see an AM containing deposit address that you did not generate, that indicates one of the other MGW operators (or someone somehow spoofing them) has gone rogue. Alerts globally, send in swat team<br /><br />If you see any MGW operator putting assets for sale on AE, even unconfirmed tx, send in swat team<br /><br />So if we prevent rogue operator from handing out bad addresses and also prevent making any sales via AE, then I think the only hole left is if they transfer the asset to a different unmonitored account.<br /><br />So all asset transfers need to be correlated with incoming deposits. Each gateway has an ID (0, 1, 2) depends on order in the MGW.conf file. Take nxt64bits of the NXT address mod 3 to select which server is responsible for sending asset transfer.<br />So if any asset transfer to NXT id that isnt matching (gatewayid % 3), send in swat teams<br /><br />Now, we are down to one third of transfers. The amount of the transfer must match the amount of a coin deposit and it must happen AFTER the coin deposit, so if you track all coin deposits you have the list of approved transfers. Anything else, send in swat teams<br /><br />Really, this is theoretical possibility and only an issue since we dont have active realtime monitors. The reality is that any rogue operator is guaranteed to be caught and quite quickly and all for the bid side orderbook for altcoin. So, possible, but unlikely and with realtime monitoring, will be detected and stopped within a few minutes<br /><br />James

Also, to place bid/ask quote on NXT AE it costs 1 NXT, another 1 NXT to cancel. With InstantDEX no cost unless an order is filled. Also, InstantDEX is dynamically making orderbooks for all asset &lt;-&gt; asset trades, including where &quot;asset&quot; is NXT. NXT AE only supports trades based in NXT.<br /><br />Now if you dont already have the data feeds setup and the signal processing algos, then those are significant advantages, not to mention the ability to be able to run a tradebot without having to deal with all the various blockchains directly. I intent to add function calls that allow some pretty cool functionality, basically the ability to programmatically invoke NXTservices functions within a tradebot.<br /><br />Remember, I only started this tradebot language this past weekend and it is just Tuesday <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James

I believe this is the weakest link as the actual depositing of the coin and withdraw is done by the user and secured by verifying NXT id in the requesting transaction. and the coin withdraw is done using consensus and multisig in the batch withdraw<br /><br />There is also the possibility of a rogue MGW operator to send fake deposit addresses via AM, but this is something that everyone will be able to see, so considering it would be detected before any user is likely to even make a deposit, seems a very foolish risk to take. People using MGW client would be able to verify that the address is legit and I will make a realtime MGW monitoring daemon to run on my server to make sure all deposit addresses are valid, no excess assets have been transferred, etc.<br /><br />Now, it would really be nice if there could be another dev to help with this! I know exactly what needs to be done and this sort of stuff would be great learnings for someone. As it is, since I trust myself, I worry not much about the asset issuer and also in reality if anybody things that there will be 100 BTC of altcoin buy orders on NXT AE anytime soon, I will make a wager on opposite side <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I estimate that in the beginning the volumes will not be of such large volumes, so all this worrying is good to identify the issues (that I already have plans for) and make people aware, but since the competition are the totally centralized exchanges where we dont even know if they are using fractional reserve, MtGox, etc.<br /><br />So, get me another coder if you want all the MGW monitoring stuff ASAP. Get me Phasing if you want the unbound assets under multisig protection.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. If anybody wants to make MGW easier to build, that help is also appreciated. I can only do so much and I am no expert on build environments and I also not so good at linkers

Imagine we support a brand new coin with a high initial volume and we are alone (coin not yet on an other exchange). I think it would do havoc to the price of this altcoin if one operator would run with the coinassets under his control and I also think it would be quite lucrative.<br /><br />Additionally users and operators have to fully trust the asset issuer, since he holds the unbound assets. <br /><br />So in sum, instead of having to trust one entity (existing exchange), the user has to trust four entitities. <br /><br />Since everyone else seems to be cool about it, what am I missing?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>1/3 of daily volume is typically much smaller than ALL the deposits, which are unaccounted for in central exchanges. I think you are overlooking that MGW provides realtime balance info of unspent outputs and outstanding assets.<br />So, the block that any unauthorized activity is detected, all the MGW servers can stop processing withdraws and theoretically all the clients can start flashing alerts so people know to stop making bid orders in AE. Of course, any outstanding bids could be all filled by the rogue operator.<br /><br />I would assume that in a centralized exchange, any employee could turn rogue and do some sort of similar thing. But the amount they would have access to is all the deposits.<br /><br />Now you talk about &quot;entities&quot;, I expect that uMGW operators will be just one person, so the risk exposure is 1/3 of daily balance times three people plus unbound assets in my hands. Not sure how many peoples a centralized exchange have working for them with access to funds, but any larger operation would be more than 1 person.<br /><br />Due to this risk, I suggest that only trusted members are allowed to run uMGW servers. Would 10 BTC worth of altcoin assets tempt someone to throw away their reputation? Highly doubtful. More likely is that their acct gets hacked somehow, so we need to make sure all uMGW operators have high entropy passwords (somehow without requiring them to divulge it) and have adequate opsec in place<br /><br />Once we get Phasing, then we can make it so 100 nodes have to agree for any asset transfer to be allowed. These 100 nodes can be a cross section of trusted members who are running MGW client that is able to monitor MGW status in realtime. Now this is not in place yet, but I cant think of any centralized solution that can lock things down like this! With Phasing, we can transfer ALL unbound assets to the Phased acct and the MGW operators wont even have any assets as all transfers would only be triggered by deposits detected by the validating nodes.<br /><br />I think you are not realizing the potential of a realtime peer reviewed gateway. Now until Phasing is here I cant implement this, but my design is based on having this eliminate the few trust points in initial MGW. The coins are multisig protected, so actually it is the asset purchasers who are at risk from rogue operator and not the coin depositors. So, the people buying the assets need to be comfortable with the MGW operators and understand they are trusting these operators not to go rogue.<br /><br />Also if there is some new coin that gets so much volumes, we can always spread the volumes to different uMGW clusters.<br /><br />Instead of theoretical possibilities, the key question is what are the chances that the specific uMGW operators go rogue? With MGW we can personalize the risk assessment, this is also pretty unique.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. If you think even 1,000 BTC worth of buy orders on AE would tempt me to go rogue with unbound assets, then you shouldnt use MGW.
