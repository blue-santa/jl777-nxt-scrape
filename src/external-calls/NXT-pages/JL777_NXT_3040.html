People keep worry about the &quot;centralization&quot; of MGW, so maybe having multiple clusters is the way to go. All I know is I am spending time every day babysitting MGW servers and with my bad ISP, it is not so happy time for me.<br /><br />This is out of my hands, but if uMGW team wants to run BTC, I think it would be a matter for there to be some setting in the Web GUI to select which MGW servers to use for each coin. Not sure if it is a good idea to be using more than one active triplet per coin.<br /><br />So, if the GUI lets you choose which coins and for each coin which triplet, then we can have a whole set of MGW triplets and limit the amount at risk with any single triplet.<br /><br />The other issue is if there will be separate mgwBTC asset or if the different triplets will use the same ones. I guess this would be a matter for the (frohicke, abeleau and domsch) and specific uMGW team to work out. If both teams are trusting of the other team, then it could be the same asset to not have any end user confusions. I fear a ripple user confusion of multiple assets for the same thing at different prices. But if the two teams do not trust the other team, there is nothing can be done.<br /><br />So, peoples, I did the tech. Let us hope that deployment can be worked out in less time than it took me to code it! In the last month+, I have made very few small bug fixes to MGW (other than making it handle uMGW)<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. maybe MGW asset holders can hold a vote using a poll if there are any controversy that cannot be solved? I control 10% via JLH, so my voice is just a small part. MGW is really a community asset and now I think time for it to become community run.

These are physical cards and possession of them can be changed with nothing on the blockchain to indicate such thing has happened.<br />I expect groups of people to pool order to be sent to a post office box and then randomly distribute amongst themselves<br />Maybe meetups? <br />These are small issues. The hard part is to get such a magical card with maximum ATM compatibility<br />I think once they are made available, we need to have peoples report compatibility with various ATM networks and country if they are OK with disclosing such things. Maybe we can just have an non place to post info to get a list of tested locations and ATM networks.<br /><br />I know I have a card from Ukraine and it works fine in Argentina, though clearly the banks are not in any sort of direct agreement. The ATM's across the world seem to be grouping into interoperable network, but I am no expert on this, coinomat is.<br /><br />James

A prepaid card is one thing - you can just buy and load them in a convenience store, no ID required - but a reloadable card means giving up too much info. The ideal for me would be the privacy of a prepaid card, but reloadable using NXT.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, I have zero experience with them.&nbsp; So you can't just buy a moneypak reloadable debit card with no name?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>this is very difficult to find, that is why I partnered with coinomat to make anon card that is not needing any personal info, it does have $10000 per month limit, but that should be ok for most people<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is a pretty amazing service. You just give them your account number and they deposit into your bank account? I don't see any details about this in the faq.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>what bank acct?<br />No, you get the cryptocard and then put the card number into a webpage form. It spits out a NXT address to deposit to. Then whenever you send NXT to that address, it autoconverts (at the price that is locked in) and puts it on the debit card.<br />From there you can use it for online purchases or even go to ATM and withdraw cash.<br /><br />No banks needed. The only possible links are that you need to receive the card via mails, but if you use a post office box in big city, this is not an issue. Also I plan to make a bunch available for cash purchases at tradeshows. Then you grab a random card, so even if somebody managed to get the list of card numbers sent to the tradeshow, there is only 1/N statistical correlation to you and only if you are identified.<br />The other info leak is the binding of NXT address to card number. Clearly using https proxy is advised, or simply internet cafe in crowded place.<br /><br />So now you have a card that can be loaded and only the people you let know about it will know about it<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. coinomat is far from USA, but the cards are working in USA. Not sure about 100% compatibility with your local ATM but I believe odds are pretty good it will work in the major ATM networks.

I play and have played online professionally for 8 years.<br /><br />With being decentralized, NXT Poker wouldn't have to adhere to any government laws, taxation. NXT Poker can tap into EVERY POKER MARKET ON THE PLANET.<br /><br />Players will not have have to declare TAX ON WINNINGS. Well they might, but impossible for the government to enforce, regulate - good luck with that. <br /><br />NXT Poker has the ability to offer the HIGHEST ROI, AND LARGEST PLAYER POOLS than has ever been seen before.<br /><br />With NXT voting, the platform could be completely democratic where the players vote for the games THEY WANT TO PLAY. No authority dictating which games are running.<br /><br />Essentially a poker platform run by the players, offering the cheapest games, highest ROI, and largest player pools.<br /><br />If you developers can build it I guarantee they will come. GUARANTEE.<br /><br />Only issue is volatility of the NXT &quot;currency&quot;; solve that problem and its GOLDEN.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>NXT volatility is not an issue, it is already solved<br />The InstantDEX/Privatebet infrastructure is most of what is needed and that will come into place in next couple months. of course everything can be done using NXTprivacy tech so no govt will even know you are playing, let alone how much you make. <br /><br />The provably fair card decks is cool problem, so I think I will add poker (and other games needing such provably fair random numbers) to Privatebet todo list. I am thinking maybe I provide the low level API and charge some small fee and others can build all the fancy GUI stuff on top of it. the envisioned privatebet GUI is really more for sportsbetting and so many GUIs needed, so I like to cooperation for this.<br /><br />James

Does it have it's own block chain? How is it related to NXT? Is that how you are implementing nxt privacy? <br /><br />If not, how is BTCD related to NXT?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I didnt launch BTCD. I was looking for coin that was floating in market price to use as conduit currency for pNXT. BTCD was trying to go with zerocoin, so I made some suggestions to their devs. They liked what they heard and next thing you know I was their core dev, but I am making a hybrid system that combines [BTCD core + NXTservices + NXT core/GUI] to have InstantDEX, tradebots, Privatebet, etc.<br /><br />Afterall software is software so as long as it has a context to run, it works.<br />Then as I was finishing the turing complete tradebots C based scripting, Teleport appeared in my head and my evaluation was that it was better than cryptonote, so I abandoned the idea of basing NXTprivacy on cryptonote and switched to making it based on Teleport. Side benefit is that the multisig approach I also got hit with yesterday will work with NXT.<br /><br />So, think of BTCD as something that has NXTservices. By installing BTCD you will get NXTservices and privacyServers, InstantDEX, etc.<br /><br />The NXTprivacy code piggy backing itself in the BTCD core will be able to teleport (and multisig) any other currency, at least once the glue API is implemented for each coin. BTCD itself will be able to teleport for normal tx fees, but it will charge other coins 1/1024th tx as a transporter fee. For NXT, I will discount this significantly, maybe to just a few NXT. Havent decided yet, so NXT will have a special place within BTCD universe, especially since the NXT AE and other features will be heavily relied upon by NXTservices.<br /><br />I know it is a bit confusing, but the key thing to remember is that it is just NXTservices, just happens to be integrated into BTCD core that is in C++.<br /><br />I would love to be able to integrate this into NXT core, but last I heard jean-luc was saying &quot;over my dead body&quot; about anything non-Java going inside the core. Maybe someone will want to translate teleport into Java? I will help this process. I just cant do it. I am super fluent with C and everything I understand. With Java, it looks the same, but I would have to really slow down my coding speed. Like looking up every word in the dictionary<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Also when I started talking about all my crazy stuff, the Boolberry guys kindly asked me to stop confusing their thread, and to go elsewhere. Since then, well their price vs BTCD price, opposite directions. Not anything like ripple hostility, and still on good terms with them, I just didnt get an open welcome from BBR guys. With BTCD, it seems they were waiting for someone like me, really just random chance, could have been some other coin I guess, but right place right time and all that

This directly helps NXT demand<br /><br />Anyway, I am pushing forward this within BTCD and when other coins see the amazing features that it gets, I believe many will want to do this. While a lot of people have heard of NXT, few have actually used it and from a bitcoin-QT GUI to NXT GUI! just imagine the difference and people are seeing this and this makes NXT more solid.<br /><br />So, how many coins out there struggling to get new features to stay competitive? Maybe each one not so big user base, but what if we can convince DOGE to do the &quot;NXT inside&quot; GUI?<br />I am too busy for marketing/selling this idea, I just make example with BTCD. If any marketing types are interested in this approach, PM me<br /><br />James<br /><br />

If it is automated, processing $1000 or $1000000 is not so much different. Maybe a few more servers, oh, its decentralized so it doesnt use its own servers. Maybe more office space, nope, no needing of office space<br /><br />I do agree there will need to be more people for support, but if it is making such millions, then how is this a problem? I arrange to pay people for the work that they do. Do I need a corporation to use the &quot;send NXT&quot; command? If they need fiat, they ask to be paid to their credit card or anon card address.<br /><br />I dont think you fully understand the implications of what I am creating.<br />Automate as much as possible, then there will be people/companies that I can pay to take care of what isnt automated<br /><br />Having no fixed overhead means even if revenues are small, that's OK. If revenues are high, then portion of revenues pays for incremental costs. There is no need for a nation state to give seal of approval and allow to have all the rules entangle everything. Anyway, what country to incorporation in?<br /><br />I choose NXT nation!<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can understand how decentralized works. It's just when the system is distributed but requiring some centralization that I see potential difficulty. But you normally solve any problems when they arise, so I've no doubt you'll do that as things progress. You'll probably code up some Virtual Corporations once the scripting languages are working that'll have everything working smoothly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>tradebots + telepods + multisig = virtual corps<br />I see this now as no big challenge, probably just a few weeks work but since this is not even an issue now I worry no about it<br />Anyway I need to have something to do next year <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />

So, if the MGW server run low, make sure to let him know and he will replenish. I just sent 20 million+ mgwBTC 3039824158801185747 and 80 million+ mgwLTC 8729570878548688448, so now anon136 has all that plus all the world's silver!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S.
