Is this something that could be looked into? It would allow for 15 BTC mgw servers and could be set up for 3 of 15 so only 3 servers are needed to make the payment. <br /><br />I know that doesn&#039;t solve the issue for BTCD, Litecoin, but I expect the BTC gateway would be the most popular especially if it gets up and highly stable and performant.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I could add support for different MofN, in fact the only 2 of 3 limitation in DB MGW API is the API syntax and stuffing it into an AM, so probably a few days work to get it ready for 3 of 15.<br /><br />Practically speaking, we have had a difficult time finding 3 hosts. Please find me a dozen more and I will spend the few days to expand the API syntax<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That's a little snarky, Do you really need 12 more? Right now you need 100% of the 3 you have to be up, running and in synch. Each 1 you add reduces that and increases the uptime.<br /><br />I would be willing to run a node, even if I had to personally pay for it. I decent VPS wouldn't be more than $10 a month or so.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>not sure exactly what snarky means, but I apologize if I offended. I have been thinking about this, but this feels like the case where having fewer, but more trusted parties is actually better.<br /><br />I know, heresy.<br /><br />But with the nature of multisig, if there are not M signatures, the funds are burned. And the larger N/M is the more likely to get collusion being possible, especially if it is fully decentralized. So, while the uptime might be a good advantage, but the moment the attacker gets M sockpuppets controlling nodes, then all the unspent deposits are gone. Well after the attacker messes around with bitcoin multisig and screams at the horribleness for a while, then it is finally gone. <br /><br />Another issue is the unavailability of nodes over time, as people drop out, their computers get upgraded and wallets lost, etc.<br /><br />So, short of being able to fully decentralize the spending to all nodes, this is one of those problems that I see no clean solution (yet).<br /><br />James

NXT Assets that are products/services outside the NXT economy.<br />2. NXT Assets that are products/services within the NXT economy.<br />3. NXT Assets that are heavily invested in NXT itself. <br /><br />So the 1st class of assets would drop proportionately to nxt as nxt increases in value in order to maintain correct asset valuation. <br /><br />The second class could potentially benefit from the growing nxt economy and maintain its nxt/asset price ratio however this, again depends on many factors i imagine. <br /><br />The third class of assets could actually increase in value even as nxt itself increases in value as the asset value is tied to nxt price based on holdings (example: Sharkfund?)<br /><br />It is very interesting that you mentioned that the asset prices provide a counter balance to the volatility of nxt during price spikes. Would it be akin to saying that increasing nxt demand in turn leads to increasing demand for cheap assets and this causes a counterbalancing effect? So as new money flows into the nxt ecosystem, a proportional amount flows out into assets and this tends to balance out price volatility...woah never though of it that way <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>those are a good way to categorize, as long as you understand that some assets have more than one component<br /><br />I think what you are trying to do is similar to figuring out where the water goes if there is a big storm.&nbsp; The specific rainfall and wind pattern will cause great variations in local areas, but generally speaking everything gets wet<br /><br />I do not believe there is any proportionality mechanism, other than cross market arbitrages, which might actually be enough. However, during periods of NXT downcycle, the NXT oriented assets are underperforming, so probably non-NXT assets are getting the investment. As the cycle changes, the money flows out of the non-NXT assets into the NXT assets.<br /><br />James

Now what if there was a scenario where the demand for nxt soared like never before due to a new technology or service built on nxt. This would obviously cause a price rise and let us assume that it is a 10 fold increase in price over a span of a few months. <br />My question now is, what would be the affects of this rapid price rise on the assets traded on nxt AE? Logically, i would expect all of them to suddenly go down in value 10x (relative to nxt of course) but it is clearly not as simple as that right? <br />Does anyone have any predictions on how an increasing nxt price would affect asset prices and performance? What would be a wise investment strategy in such a case?<br /><br />Some scenarios that i have been thinking related to this -<br />- Increasing price of nxt leads to larger capital for asset issuers who still hold their reserve capital in nxt. This could potentially maintain the nxt/asset price ratio and shareholders don't loose out on the nxt price rise. (Could assets really grow along with nxt?)<br />- Increased price of nxt leads to loss of capital for asset issuers who had already liquidated most of the nxt they raised to fiat / btc to pay for development of their product/asset. This could cause the asset prices to plummet as nxt prices increase and shareholders loose out on the nxt price rise. <br /><br />I am very curious and interested in the market dynamics when such a hypothetical scenario becomes a reality. Judging by the rapid development of the tech here, i don't think we are too far from this eventually happening. Any thoughts on this?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>certainly non-NXT based assets would drop approx a proportional amount<br />however assets that are all or mostly in the NXT economy should stay roughly the same in NXT terms. We saw a bit of a drop in asset prices during the spike to 15000 sats, but the change in asset prices in NXT provide a counterbalance to the volatility of NXT. <br /><br />Some assets that are able to capitalize on the rise of NXT and gain from it will actually increase faster than NXT, eg. leveraged NXT. How can something be more stable than NXT and at the same time be like a leveraged NXT?<br /><br />All depends on each asset of course. To achieve the above almost magical effect, an asset would need to have a lot of NXT backing it and also have a lot of dividends being produced that is proportional to the marketcap of NXT, something like trading commissions, usage fees, etc.<br /><br />James

After the harvest each of them brings a bag of corn to a smart guy called James, and James takes a truckload of corn to a pig farmer. There he exchanges the corn for a promise of a share of pigs once the pigs are grown. <br />As the little pigs eat the corn, grow and are slaughtered, once a month James comes to the pig farm and picks up a bunch of sausages. <br />Then he gives each of his friends a number of sausages in proportion to the amount of corn they contributed. James keeps some of the sausages himself for his time, and the rest of the corn farmers are OK with this.<br /><br />Would such a scheme be regulated as a 'security' for James? Given that he only deals with commodities, and no money exchanges hands?<br />Please do not think about the health and safety regulations concerning the transport of sausages for now :-). <br /><br />If such a scheme is not considered a 'security', why would running an asset be regulated as such if the asset handles only commodities (altcoins)?<br /><br />What terminology would we need to use to avoid words like asset, dividends, shares etc?<br /><br />I believe using financial terminology, even if it sounds 'cool' and 'professional' could come back and bite us in the a$$.<br /><br />What is NXT in this context and would the IRS or HM RS or other tax people buy it that i.e. a &quot;mining asset&quot; is really not an &quot;unregistered security&quot;?<br /><br />Feel free to shoot my argument full of holes!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I have heard that just changing what you call something, but not its nature doesnt change its legality. this makes sense.

Unless of course it just means that USSA will do whatever it wants just because it has the power to.<br /><br />I think if we are playing an online MMORPG where we are calling things this or that, it really wouldnt be legally binding, so to speak. And that is all we are doing here, playing a MMORPG with NXT and its assets, etc.<br /><br />I like your analogy, but USSA regulates all commodities too.<br /><br />Any taxation really has to happen at the fiat level. So the conversion into and out of fiat are the taxation points. Anything else is quite meaningless. Of course to protect all of us from any harm, the USSA will just pass regulations that says we need to register all our passwords with their totally secure crypto password registration system. That way they can simply just take all our play money away at anytime to protect us<br /><br />James

Chris could probably get the entire weekly mining income with about half the hashpower of what he's sold. <br /><br />Also, as printshop mentioned, he's definitely had a huge amount of hashpower going the entire time, and just gradually sells off the shares, so you're not going to see a difficulty spike when a big chunk of shares get sold.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>good point about it already been deployed from day 1 (which is some weeks ago)<br />I always thought Chris's &quot;game&quot; was to keep the DOGE for free from the merge mining<br />

This &quot;I buy the keys from all initial investors for cheap&quot; line seemed always silly to me.

And a fundamental one. Hopefully the solution kushti has in mind works out.<br /><br />Edit: Cool, some dialogue going on in reddit between kushti and Buterin.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not hard either.. especially for NXT.. in fact there are already 2 people out there who could perform such an attack.. CfB and BCNext.. remember they had a wallet address with 165 million plus Nxt in addition to Cfb's wallet<br /><br />And if you perform such an attack then any new forgers joining the network won't know which fork to take.. the ones currently forging can indeed get 90% protection though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So, a new node comes online, gets fooled into using the fake chain. Then all the other nodes blacklist it and either they try again until they are on the right chain or just never get accepted into the real network.<br /><br />So, this is not really an attack on the NXT network, it is a way that might prevent some people from joining the real network.<br /><br />Maybe they setup 1000 nodes with this fake chain? At some point dont you think the real NXT community notices this and does something to alert people? Just looking at the blockchain sites anybody can tell the fake chain is not right.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. For this amount of effort, wouldnt it just be easier to DDOS every single NXT node? Maybe you will like my EMP attack<br /><br />
