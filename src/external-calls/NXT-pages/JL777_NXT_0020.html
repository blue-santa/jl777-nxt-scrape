I told my analysis had a detail to be clarified and it is close to what you wrote. The effect of the delta can be adjusted by the velocity of the asset trading. I dont have any recent stats on how much NXT is tied up in bids for assets, but certainly it isnt 100% of the assetcap.<br /><br />And your method would roughly balance the value according to market forces and over time, it might not be so bad. Except for the first days where there will be massive market movements, which most assets should recover from in time. However, since the NXT holders are the ones that have the option to burn for fNXT, then it becomes possible that they make decisions without any consideration to the asset holders. So the PoS protection is missing for asset holders in NXT.&nbsp; Which means the community has to create social protections to prevent force wealth transfers. Or just let whatever happens at the decison of the big NXT holders who dont care about assets and lose all the assets, we lost some devs, some website, maybe its ok to lose assets and asset investors. [All this applies to MS also, but there are much less capital there, still it is a principled issue]<br /><br />So it could be possible to end up with 80% fNXT and 20% NXT, which would be a problem big enough to affect the external markets. Or maybe it is 20/80 the other way, in which case we end up with no network security.<br /><br />And still the silver deflation effect is not solved, though its negative effect is lessened a bit.<br /><br />Exactly when was it decided that NXT itself MUST be prunable? That &quot;decision&quot; is what is causing all of these problems. And it is made not by any represented group, not even the NXT holders. After BC2, I realized I will have to wait a while for the API to stabilize before resuming coding for NXT other than the mininum amount necessary. Most people thought I was just being on an ego trip, but the fNXT is the same type of thing to asset holders and now they can relate to why I got so upset with BC2. The reality is that if breaking changes to API is spun into &quot;progress&quot; and anybody against it is lazy or against progress, we will lose developers and websites. I am still waiting for a firm believable commitment to API backward compatibility. If NXT want more developers, BC is needed.<br /><br />If NXT wants to retain more than a handful of hobby assets, assets must continue to trade against the full NXT currency. It is not about technical details, it is about money.<br /><br />NXT is currently 100% centralized, there is not even a commitment to honor the voting result of the NXT holders and certainly no rights for the AE community. Now since NXT is even seriously discussing doing this, with pruning NXT a fait accompli, it is already seeing a significant negative reaction and I am not sure it can be fully fixed. But the longer things go without a total cancellation of the fNXT splitting, the more assets NXT will lose and at some point if it is clear that fNXT is going to happen I will be forced to move all my assets, including SuperNET elsewhere, probably to a hybrid BTC/BTCD setup so you can get the speed of 1 minute blocks BTCD has and the security of BTC for archival/cold storage.<br /><br />I apologize for the prognosis, but unfortunately I have no power to change this and little influence. This is my final attempt to save NXT as the BC2 combined two separate incidents back to back where I was totally ignored and made perfectly clear to me that I dont matter and I wasnt welcome. I really get negatively affected by these type of things and my work suffers, so I cannot spend a lot of time. I saved up my analysis and posted here. <br /><br />I simply cannot be part of a community that is not a community, but rather a cult which unthinkingly adopts any change mandated by the leader, regardless of the feedback or effects on others. And dont get me started on this pretending to listen to the community. My estimate was that if I did not do these hard truths posts, that 99.9% chance for fNXT and the end of NXT as we know it. Maybe it is still 99% chance, but I had to make one last try.<br /><br />I will respond to math based analysis, but I dont have time for posts that ignore that when you subtract from something, it becomes smaller. You know, that math thing.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. For asset holders who are afraid tl:dr dont be afraid, if forced to there will be a migration path, there are plenty of blockchain AE solutions available already and over the next year I see no problem for transitioning, even if I have to write one from scratch. coloredcoins.org among others.

Now there is even less &quot;water in the lake&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />James, what do you think of creating an additional billion of NXT at the hard fork to add more 'water to the lake' such that the system total supply is 2 billion NXT + 1 billion fNXT? Should this provide more liquidity to the asset market in your estimation?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I thought about that, it would solve the hardfork event, but not the long term devaluation of the reference currency. It would definitely reprice the assets so the good ones and bad ones alike will get a much more accurate pricing relative to each other.<br /><br />The fact that doubling the coin supply isnt enough to fix this should give an idea of the magnitude of this change.<br /><br />Another idea that i think evildave had which was promising was allowing NXT &lt;-&gt; fNXT at anytime, but since it has been declared that it will cost 100 fNXT per transfer, it is not practical. Even if it was 1NXT, the cost of that might be a barrier. <br /><br />For people who have half or more of their value in NXT, they would be ok, but this requires everyone to be arbitraging against an unknowable delta factor against everyone else. So most would wait and see what the actual market price of fNXT will be, but if it is not on exchanges, what is its value?<br /><br />Keeping the total at 1 billion, has liquidity problems at the hardfork and long term problems of the non-currency as the reference. And the after effect of declassifying NXT as money as was done to silver in 1873 is a very long term effect<br /><br />Since it was decided that we cannot accept 1GB/year of blockchain bloat, nor can some special cases be maintained, we end up with a very clean software design that instead of rewarding the AE ecosystem investors and participants, just tells them &quot;you should never have sold your NXT&quot; But we worked very hard to get people to build this ecosystem, its not like they did it against the wishes of NXT. But it is everyone's responsibility that they trusted NXT to not devalue the reference currency that assets were based on. There was never any promise to do that and even if there was it would be unenforceable. Allocating handouts/bailouts or whatnot is no solution.<br /><br />Really the question is do we break the implicit promise to the AE ecosystem or not. The fact that I am seeing so much resistance to NXT not throwing the AE under the bus makes me very sad. The reality is that after BC2 as I warned development of third party devs is slowed down and the ones not making money even decided to not bother to revise the &quot;trivial&quot; changes needed. I warned that not living up to the BC expectation and promise would hurt NXT. I was right, since I know about developers.<br /><br />If the implicit AE promise is broken and now we have devs who cant rely on BC and AE that cant rely on even fundamental things like the reference currency not being totally changed, then the hopes of signing up lots of childchains hinges on them not doing their research into the past. I am speaking the brutal truth here as a lot of cheerleading has been done on this issue that goes totally against the reality of business. You cannot ignore the interests of millions of dollars invested without severe consequences. And since the only power asset issuers have is to move, that is what will happen. I am not making any ultimatums, or threats or FUD. Just explaining the logic and reality. <br /><br />fNXT means not many assets left, but maybe that is exactly the plan?<br /><br />James

Now there is even less &quot;water in the lake&quot;<br /><br />The number of fNXT doesnt matter so much, it can be just 10,000 of them. They are isolated, high friction and meant to just forge. They are the gold bars in the fort knox.<br /><br />The closest model to what is being proposed that I know of (I am sure there are better ones) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1873" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1873</a><br /><br />It was caused by the US going to a gold standard. Which doesnt sound so bad, but prior to that it was both gold and silver that were basically the currency status. So we have two halves that are together before the 1873 and afterwards only the gold, with silver having to stand alone on its noncurrency uses. <br /><br />so current NXT is modeled by pre 1873 (gold + silver) (fNXT + NXT)<br />after 1873 gold/fNXT and silver/NXT2.0<br /><br />Silver price crashed, and anything denominated in silver suffered. Most of you probably dont remember things back in 1873, but it was pretty grim, only the great depression of the 1930&#039;s was worse.<br /><br />Splitting a currency and demoting part of it to non-currency status will devalue that part. It is logical, I have math and historical support.<br /><br />Now, does it matter if the effect is 1% or 10% or 50% or 90%? Is this a quantitative &quot;if the pain isnt too much, then why not&quot; sort of thing, or is this a qualititative &quot;forcing a voiceless subset of the community by fiat declaration is something we just dont even think about doing&quot; thing?<br /><br />Now most people intuitively felt this will cause an asset selloff, but I am not so sure that is what will happen. But the feeling that people had that this will be bad for assets is very likely correct as I have shown. The only question is how bad will the effect be and that depends on &quot;delta&quot; which is not knowable.<br /><br />Fear, Uncertainity, Doubt caused by this. Sorry to those who didnt realize the truth behind the likely event of this, I cannot help that the analysis comes out this way. <br /><br />I just dont see any solution that decouples assets from all of NXT. NXT suffered during BTC&#039;s bear market, there is no debate for this. Assets suffered during NXT&#039;s bear market, there is no debate for this. Clearly the reference currency you are based on is very very significant and the instant devaluation by the delta factor cannot be papered over.<br /><br />Since asset issuers have no direct power and NXT holders will follow their self interest and go to the 2.0 fork, there are really not many options for asset issuers that care about their investors. Even if the devaluation is temporary, unless it can be strictly quantified and planned for (highly unlikely) the risk that it could start a prolonged bear market/depression as in 1873 to 1880+, asset issuers would have to vote against this. <br /><br />However as past issues have shown, only NXT holders have any power in NXT, so being disenfranchised the only power asset issuers have is mobility. asset issuer have no power within NXT, but the have all the power within their asset. I am very disappointed that the general tone has been that asset investors have somehow been disloyal since they actually sold their NXT to invest in the ecosystem. That somehow Mr 4788... is the ideal NXTer that we should all strive to become. <br /><br />AE is the majority of NXT transactions. AE is what has allowed NXT to develop to where it is now and its ecosystem was growing gradually, but BC2 created an&nbsp; extinction event and now fNXT. Time is running out for the NXT community to show that it is actually a community that values the AE ecosystem, or if the biggest priority is some mythical price pump<br /><br />James

Not sure yet, where we disagree exactly.<br /><br />Overall, i do think NXT token will decrease in value, of course, but not as much as 50% as you claim because fNXT and NXT are not equal in functionnality. At fork, a part of the value is transfer to fNXT, it would be equal to it &quot;forging value&quot;, if I can say it like that. However, since everyone will get 1:1 at fork, I think I do not lose anything. I will have the same total value as the value loss by NXT will only be transfer to fNXT. <strong>The total Nxt platform valuation will stay the same, I believe</strong>, heu wait, it will increase actually I believe, since 2.0 will be much more powerfull than 1.x, but this is another subject.<br /><br />Most assets are value by investor in fiat or btc. When I invested in asset I knew my investment was not related to NXT value anymore, but to the underlying value of the asset, e.g. &quot;speculation valuation&quot;, btc or fiat if there is dividends (superbtc or NXTUSD dividends).<br /><br />There are very few asset where the underlying value creation of the asset come from NXT. I'm thinking of neodice, but that the only one I have in mind, since it is for gambling NXT and should give NXT dividends as a consequence. For a time there were also the gambling asset from twin that was NXT based, but it is not there anymore.<br /><br />This is what I think. <br />(disclaimer, for each 2 NXT I have, I have 3NXT value in asset)<br /><br /><br />edit, I should add that, NXT value after fork should decrease, but asset value after fork should not decrease unless it underlying value creation come from NXT. Total Nxt platform valuation will simply be split between Nxt and fNxt, imho.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Why would asset prices decrease after the hardfork?<br />It has to increase proportionally to the dilution just to get back to where it was, if it will decrease after being diluted, then things are much worse for assets.<br /><br />My very strong point that nobody has refuted is that fNXT has value, therefore it is dilutive to NXT. However NXT supply is fixed, so there is instant deflation, but it is not a deflation for everyone, just for people who have things price in NXT since people with only NXT are fully compensated.<br /><br />The ones without NXT are suffering from an immediate loss from the devaluation without repricing, and then a long term suffering due to lower prices overall since there is just not enough NXT to reprice all the assets in any short amount of time.<br /><br />Think about a lake. One day, half the water is separated into a different place and there is no more contact. Overall the same amount of water, so who would care?<br /><br />Well the fish in the lake now have only half the water to swim in. Over time the rainfall will restore the lake back to where it was. How long will this take? Nobody can know ahead of time.<br /><br />There is no debate it is devaluing NXT. I dont think there is a debate about the fact that if you devalue something arbitrarily by fiat declaration this is not a good thing. So, let us admit it for what it is and then we can see if that is what we want to do.<br /><br />All this talk about how wonderful 2.0 will be is not really important, if assets are mistreated like this. And short of binding contracts signed by entities the contracts can be enforced against, there is no assurance there will be any specific childchain. And even if there was, how exactly does this benefit NXT? fNXT gets the benefit and NXT has to compete against the childchains who have the same feature set. So really, the future is wonderful part is not any help to the poor assets that are still linked to NXT and not to fNXT.<br /><br />If you build a house in the nice part of town and then somebody else decides to tax you by some unspecified amount and then move all the cool futuristic things that caused you to build your house there in the first place and then you find out that many other towns are now able to benefit from the very things you helped to create, but you are stuck and now have no cool tech to differentiate yourself since all the childchains have the same tech.<br /><br />But hey, your asset price got cut by delta and it will eventually be so fantastic.<br /><br />You really dont see any problems with the above scenario?<br /><br />James<br /><br />

However, NXT is now worth (1 - delta), so to compesate delta with units worth (1 - delta) we need delta / (1 - delta)<br /><br />I think I got that right.<br /><br />if delta is 0.5 (50%), that means 0.5 / (1 - 0.5) = 1.0<br />That means the entire supply of NXT is needed to compesate for this delta<br /><br />if delta is 0.1, then it isnt so bad 0.1 / 0.9 = .11 or 11%<br /><br />So even though we cant know what delta will be, we can calculate the effect on things at different deltas.<br /><br />Did I make a math error somewhere?<br /><br />James

It is not pure inflation like in stock when all share are equal in functionnality. The value of the fNxt/Nxt token will split between those two token, but not like a 50%/50% distribution of the value. Of course there will be some market reajustment after fork. Since NXT token will have all functionnality except forging I expect it will be value more than fNxt at fork (fNxt will only be good for forging), but will lose some value because it can't forge anymore. This value will be transfer to the fNXT. If distribution is 1:1 fNxt/Nxt at fork, no one is losing at that particular moment (the fork) since everyone will hold the same token values and functionnalities as before and after fork.<br /><br />This part of your post only spread fud, imho.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are you familiar with macroeconomics?<br />What is happening with the NXT/fNXT split that is causing the most negative reaction is that assuming fNXT has equal value to NXT the moment of the hardfork, HALF (50%) of the money supply vanishes.<br /><br />Now, imagine if in your country, overnight half the money supply just vanished, but they are now safely inside bank vaults where it cant really be spent.<br /><br />HALF the money supply being converted to a non-liquid form.<br /><br />So an asset that is priced at 35 stays at 35, but it really should be 70 as NXT is worth half (plz let us not debate the exact ration of 2:1 as nobody really knows, we just know it is significant)<br /><br />OK, so where does this 35 NXT come from?<br /><br />Remember this is not a microeconomic (applying to specific entities) but macroeconomic (applying to all), so ALL assets are now mispriced by a factor of 2, the total asset market cap is what? higher than 1 billion NXT, so even if the market wanted to reprice, it couldnt and there is only about 300 million NXT in circulation. That is enough liquidity to reprice JINN asset and then there is no more NXT for anything else.<br /><br />This is pretty basic economics. When the market is flooded with cash, things inflate. When the market has its cash removed, it deflates. So we have a devaluation via deflation.<br /><br />If the price of something needs to be doubled to maintain its value, there needs to be twice as much capital in that denomination or there is a liquidity crunch. Doesnt matter the quality of asset, it applies across the board. But it will hurt the worse assets really bad, in fact there might be no bids at all for many assets as all the NXT is used up.<br /><br />Once there is such a drop in value, it destablizes markets and could make a long lasting downtrend (start or continue)<br /><br />James

They are separated. You can be shareholder or client or both, but a user is not automatically also a shareholder.<br /><br />You have company structures where users are also automatically shareholders but these models are much less successful. <br /><br />Maybe the same applies here?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It has been a while but I have continued to support NXT within SuperNET (MGW, mynxt.info, instantdex), I just dont have the energy to be attacked when I try to help.<br /><br />I warned that breaking Backward Compatibility is a bad idea, specifically that I literally didnt have any more time in the day to redo my software due to API changes. Then the data became prunable and permanent data 10x more expensive. A hardcap of 160 bytes was justified to keep the size of the blockchain low. OK, fine. I have no influence and it was made clear I wasnt welcome here, so I just did what had to be done to keep the SuperNET services working.<br /><br />However I stated that as long as NXT didnt break the way assets work that there was no reason to change from the NXT as the financial platform.<br /><br />fNXT model breaks the way assets work. I am not talking about any onetime distribution issue, that is not the problem. The asset selloff for the expected NXT pump, that also is not an issue.<br /><br />The primary issue is that assets will be using NXT as the reference currency. A NXT that is a childchain subordinated to fNXT, the preferred stock that has all the power. If a stock does a 2:1 split, the price is automatically adjusted so everyone ends up with the same value. In the upcoming fNXT:NXT split, there is no such mechanism, all asset will immediately lose half their value, but will the hardfork double all AE bids/asks, I doubt it. So will the market readjust the prices back to where it was? In a perfectly efficient market, yes, but we have the cost of tx to cancel and submit a new quote and the extra effort it would take. But the biggest issue is that there simply isnt enough liquidity. I am not talking about asset liquidity, I am talking about NXT liquidity. There just is not enough NXT to allow a doubling of the prices. Primarily because there isnt an extra billion NXT, it is an extra billion fNXT. So irrespective of an asset's quality there will be a massive liquidity squeeze. This magnitude of a liquidity crisis is seldom seen in the real world, maybe the gold shortage caused depressions in the 1800's. The reality is that to make the fNXT plan neutral from the immediate 50% haircut, all AE prices need to be doubled. And to do that would require doubling the NXT supply and issuing another billion NXT. But still that doesnt balance out the loss of future growth due to fNXT present and future value, so the extra billion NXT is just the start. Of course, it probably wont work to just double the supple, though I heard ripple did it and it worked out fine.<br /><br />But supposedly NXT will gain value from 2.0, but how? NXT isnt the main chain anymore. NXT doesnt benefit directly from childchains and might even be hurt by them, or simply priced out of existence. NXT doesnt have the forging power any more, so it basically becomes like an asset or MS coin is now. Nothing wrong with that, but this does nothing to strenghten NXT and that is what the assets were issued on. NXT and its future. That future is now inside fNXT.<br /><br />The way I understand it, NXT would be prunable subject to paying whatever fees the fNXT nodes required. So if there are many successful childchains, NXT could simply get priced out and then pruned away. There does not seem to be any provision to guarantee archival nodes will always be there.<br /><br />Also, NXT goes from having exclusive rights to all the new features to non-exclusive. If any of you are familiar with intellectual property and the difference between exclusive and non-exclusive, you know how important it is. It is hard to quantify, might be 2x or 10x or 100x, depends on specific scenario. In no scenario does demoting NXT to child chain benefit NXT.<br /><br />If there are no significant child chains, then all this chaos is for nothing.<br /><br />The security model for childchains cannot be evaluated until more details are known and even then having a track record of 2+ years vs 0 months, will make childchains security not as strong as fNXT security, even if mathematically they are identical.<br /><br />Now, how important is security to an asset investor? Of course, very important.<br /><br />1 + 1 = 2<br />I dont think many people will debate me about that.<br />NXT 2.0 + fNXT = NXT<br />Let us assume the value of the two is the same. the NXT after 2.0 + fNXT vs current NXT. As I wrote above NXT2.0 is not worth as much as NXT, impossible to know exactly how much less, but it is significant, especially since the expectation of future grown goes to childchain and fNXT, with NXT left behind. And clearly fNXT has value, possible the majority of value if the expectations are that childchains are going to be significant. <br /><br />Now remember that the price of ALL assets and MS coins are cut the moment of the hard fork by the ratio of old value vs new value and the liquidity on the fNXT side is effectively locked away with the 100NXT/tx fee.<br /><br />So in addition to looking at an immediate loss of 50%, beyond that it could get worse in the event the value of NXT is below half the combined NXT2.0+fNXT. <br /><br />The fNXT issuing protects the holders of NXT and its price will probably increase leading up to the fNXT hardfork, which appears to already be fully decided based on the posts I see. However if assets and MS are immediately losing half the price and long term without any mechanism to recover it, this is basically a wealth transfer of the 50% magnitude. If anybody is wondering why asset issuers and investors are upset, hopefully my post will open your eyes.<br /><br />It is one thing to just change the API and upset third party developers, after all coders are so easy to find, who cares about losing developers. And long time sites that couldnt financially justify the development costs to retool for a new API, who needs those anyway.<br /><br />I am speaking as a businessman, investor and asset issuer. Areas that I have proven skills in, but it probably doesnt matter that I understand business, financing, and issuing assets. I also had proven skills in the tech side all my warnings about the API issues were ignored. However in the asset area I created more asset values that everybody else combined for quite a while and that includes not just NXT but all decentralized platforms. And I did that in a span of just over a year. <br /><br />My biggest priority is to protect the millions of dollars invested into my assets. Since the NXT is apparently unconcerned about what the effects of totally changing the financial scope of the reference currency would do to everybody who built on top of it, I will have to take proactive steps to do so.<br /><br />I knew the BC2 incident was going to hurt NXT and I tried to stop it and warn people, but that got turned around into somehow it being my fault that promises made after BC1 were broken and that I didnt compromise. Then a big FUD storm against me and SuperNET pushed the price of it below the value of just the core coins it held, wiping out all the gains. So I was reluctant to say anything due to the &quot;shoot the messenger&quot; thing that happened last time.<br /><br />I have been silent, but when this farce of community &quot;feedback&quot; is making it clear that it has already been decided by fiat that NXT will be massively devalued permanently, I decided to make an appearance directly. So please if you want to just make me upset, attack me for what the NXT is forcing down our throats without regard to the millions of dollars at stake.<br /><br />At this point I am reacting to protect investors in my assets. If you are such a person, do not worry. If indeed this fNXT plan moves forward without any protections to asset holders, there will be a way to transition off of the NXT blockchain to where it can be priced and traded against BTC and other currencies.<br /><br />Anyway, I dont want to get into any extended back and forth. I just wanted to state my position that I will protect investors in my assets and unless there is a believable plan that protects asset holders interests against the issues I raise in this post and any other that might arise, then my hand will be forced. Do not bother trying to convince me to compromise as I do not have the power to just let half the investors value get &quot;temporarily&quot; pushed down by 50% without any clear path to recoup it. If you want to prevent this migration, you need to prevent fNXT and I have ZERO influence over that. I couldnt even get small API change reversed. <br /><br />I will converse as long as things stay civil, but really I do not have the tolerance to being called names and being insulted. <br /><br />For all your NXTers without any assets and just love this fNXT plan, just imagine if instead of a 1:1 distribution, all the fNXT would go to only people who have the camelmilk asset. From the asset holders point of view it is a similar type of wealth transfer, even if the ones who are benefiting might not benefit at all, it is clear that fNXT has very little chance of helping assets and a very significant chance to hurt them.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I will not be making technical advices as it is clear that I dont get any respect in that area from the NXT devs, so it is no point to deal with this technically as I clearly dont have the capacity to understand java and it could very well be technical limitations caused by java. I speak about the financial aspects. I will probably lose another million dollars of net worth due to this post, but I am trying to save NXT.

Remember the bitcoin OP_RETURN change to 40 bytes that broke counterparty because the core devs didnt like such use cases? this reminds me of that.<br /><br />One the one hand you dont want to discourage use of aliases, on the other hand you go out of your way to discourage use of MGW.<br /><br />Will you just start calling me names again?<br /><br />James

					BTC txfee is .0001 -&gt; ~3 cents and you can put at least 80 bytes in OP_RETURN on the BTC blockchain.<br /><br />would you pay more to store data in the NXT blockchain vs the BTC blockchain?<br /><br />economics<br /><br />price elasticity<br /><br />these are not hard to understand. expensive things have less volumes than less expensive things.<br /><br />If the cost to use NXT storage is the most expensive in all of crypto, then it will probably become the least used blockchain storage. Basically unless the effective cost to use NXT is significantly lower than BTC, new use cases wont use NXT. And if it is more expensive, current use cases will be economically forced to migrate<br /><br />There has been 2 years for NXT ecosystem to develop around the 1NXT per tx and 1000 bytes pricing. If the cost goes up, the usage will go down. If the cost goes down, the usage might go up.<br /><br />Why not make it cost 1000 NXT per tx and another 100NXT per byte used? that will make 1000x the forging income and everybody will want to forge NXT<br /><br />James

He'd need to know how long for. <br /><br />Increasing the maximum from 160 to 200 bytes might also be possible; Jean-Luc doesn't seem to want to, but I've not seen any rationale for why 160 bytes is the magic number here, rather than 128 or 256. Currently the vote seems to favour 2 NXT basic fee, so 200 bytes would cost 14 NXT. Of course, the next rounds of voting might push the cost up to 21 NXT or 28 NXT. That would provide SuperNet with some incentive to switch to prunable data, so after a while hopefully few transactions would actually be using the extra 40 bytes. Maybe the limit could be dropped again in a year's time, if nobody then needs it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the minimum size that can be used to correlate a BTC deposit would be the txid + vout, so that is 32 bytes of high entropy + integer, 34 bytes takes care of most cases, but if BTC blocks get bigger and we see more than 65536 vouts in a tx, 35 bytes would be needed.<br /><br />However, this requires more than just server settings changes and would require a new round of testing. in any case I cannot fit 35 bytes into 32, so it is a moot point as it has been declared that 32 bytes is the limit. Also this assumes only BTC deposits, so all the coins would need to be scanned and what if there is a txid collision between blockchains? It is possible and actually happened in the early btc blockchain, so add another byte for the coin. maybe there will be some other things that are nice to have, like the NXT address of 8 bytes. some coin's txid dont fit into 32 bytes, etc.<br /><br />As far as how long, this is&nbsp; a question for vanbreuk and the new MGW dev<br /><br />James
