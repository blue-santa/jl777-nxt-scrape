In the laborious process of getting a Windows dev environment setup.

Are you planning to have a &quot;browse&quot; feature instead of search? So you click &quot;browse&quot; and it brings up the top 50ish top level categories, you click on one of them and get a list of subcategories, click on one and get sub-sub categories, etc.?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Since there is no enforcement of categories, I think this is necessary. I expect there will be a browse API that will return the top categories, and you'll be able to drill down from there. I am still thinking about the APIs that are needed from a user interface perspective, which I will then pass on to James as suggestions for new APIs that only he can make. I am happy to take suggestions like this!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am thinking about self-organizing by most listed categories. So if &quot;electronics&quot; had the most listings, it would be the first item seen.<br /><br />Or, I could grab the top N categories by number of listings and then alphabetically sort them. That would make it easier to find things, so each page will have roughly the same volume listings, but in alphabetical order.<br /><br />Doing it this way, you wont even need to figure out which is your primary, secondary, ... category!<br /><br />It will all just be based on how many other listings use the same category tag. Once you click into a specific category, then all sorts are based on frequency of categories of listings with the selected category.<br /><br />The problem I see with this is that the size of datastructures needed to cross reference everything will grow and so the total number of listings becomes a key issue. I think we need to make listings expire or have a maximum time they can be active.<br /><br />James

I was worried this wasn't a good idea <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/embarrassed.gif" alt="&#58;-&#091;" title="Embarrassed" class="smiley" /> should I still do this?

If the former, it would require a fair amount of reworking as NXT-ness is embedded throughout. <br /><br />I will make sure to keep the &quot;secret sauce&quot; internal, at least for a little bit. I will share with trusted members, so we can get a full source review<br /><br />James

This would be to protect sellers from extortion by buyers with little to no rating who would make spam accounts to use to hold sellers for ransom for their reputation.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I hope I can disagree. Doing this will allow no way for buyers to report abuses by sellers.<br />I think we have some sort of Judgement System in the works. Maybe a seller can just dispute baseless negative feedbacks. It will soon be clear if it is the buyer who is always ransoming, or if the seller is the one who is at fault.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />there is no way for a seller to dispute a baseless negative feedback because there is no authority for them to appeal to in a decentralized system. <br /><br />yes that is correct, it will soon be clear that a buyer is always ransoming, the point of this provision is to allow buyers who have little to no feeback to come to arrangements with sellers who have very strong feedback. it is to allow an entry point for people who would otherwise be caught in a viscous cycle of needing feedback to come to a deal and needing a deal to get feedback. its not for buyers with reputation.<br /><br />yes thats right. the buyer has to trust the seller. he may look at the sellers rating. or hear from a friend that he is reputable. its a voluntary transaction though so if the buyer doesnt like the terms that the seller sets than he is free to not make the exchange. thus we can axiomatically deduce that if both parties agree to the terms than they think the arrangement (the product of the terms) is in their best interest. <br /><br />thats the beauty of voluntary exchange, more options make everyone better. the only drawback of more options is not to the buyer or seller but the network as a whole in the form more spam on the blockchain. in this case its a very worthy tradeoff since it will allow deals to go through that otherwise wouldn't have because the seller would otherwise have rejected the buyer due to the risk it posed to him.<br /><br />as for the trust system, for now i was hoping that we could just piggy back ontop of the Bitcoin OTC web of trust. we can do our best to make that as simple for the users as possible but either way it will add unfortunate complexity. or alternatively how hard do you think it would be to copy the bitcoin WOT system and make something in parallel that is integrated into the client?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>bitcoin WOT seems like a whole new project, especially if you want to submit feedbacks to it. GPG, etc. Maybe its not so bad,but I am currently overloaded with yet another new bunch of protocols!<br /><br />How about this. Can you specify exactly what you need for this project? It seems that there are constantly new features, each with potentially giant amounts of work (search engine, WOT). Rather than incrementally add this, then that, etc. I would like to see the full final set of features you need. Then I can think about how best to implement it<br /><br />James

So for example in the top <strong>right</strong> of the pannel, where there is usually a search bar, what if we had filter options. So for example if someone searched for the word silver, it would remove every listing that didnt have the word silver in the title or the categories, or the tags. then everything else stays the exact same except for the fact that a huge amount of the total listings have been filtered out of the system. then they proceed to look through the now narrowed categories and sub categories to find what they are looking for. <br /><br />just tossing some thoughts around. let me know what you guys think.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />as long as you could enter multiple entries that sounds good.. say you put in silver... it will still come back with silver tv, silver platter, silver spool, silver remote ect ect... perhaps when you enter silver it creates a tag thing below the search bar that has an &quot;x&quot; to cancle that selection.. you like you would get on shopping sites when you click on certain categories..&nbsp; that way you could enter [silver] [tea] [spoon] and it would only show results that have those 3 words in it.. and if you were looking for a 32 inch samsung 3d tv you could enter [32 inch] [samsung] [3d] [tv]... if you want to see different sizes of that tv just remove the 32 inches...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />you've got it. im looking at having a bar for &quot;must include&quot; and one below for &quot;must exclude&quot;. then an button to drop down advanced filtering. in there we could have &quot;must include in title&quot; &quot;must exclude in title&quot; &quot;must include category&quot; &quot;must exclude category&quot; &quot;must include in tags&quot; &quot;must exclude in tags&quot; &quot;must include in description&quot; &quot;must exclude in description&quot;. <br /><br />That sounds like a lot but it would be pretty much everything you need to sort through as many options as you can imagine. Aside from that we just need clever ways to sort assenting and descending results. Like total amount of feedback. Positive feedback / negative feedback.&nbsp; Positive feedback / negative feedback with minimum X number of ratings in total. Just ideas there i really dont know the best sorting options to most effectively sort the wheat from the chaff but you get the idea.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>(Must include and must not include) for (title, tags, description)<br />that will be 6 optional search fields, but I think it will be quite powerful<br />I would suggest to add minprice and maxprice. <br /><br />If the search also used the current location in the three level hierarchy to apply the search to, then I think people will be able to find pretty much anything they want pretty quickly.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I didnt realize this project included as mini-search engine!
