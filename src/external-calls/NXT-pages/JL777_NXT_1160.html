How much? How often? Hourly based or project based? Also, there still need to be a vote held on the self nominated members here. Else it would be just a minority (by 1 person, the self nominated user) decision. <br /><br /><br />For me the best option is the splitting of 25% for NxtOrg, 25% NxtFoundation and 50% for developers held by pouncer and neer.g. New group formations always take a long time until they really take of. The two already established groups (NxtOrg&amp;NxtFound) are here already and working. Why take the risk of another group, which might not work at all? <br /><br />This is my opinion and not the opinion of the NxtOrg. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I will work without any pay for this.<br /><br />I am against pre-allocating any funds to any private groups. the committee should evaluate any and all external and internal proposals and decide on a case by case basis.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why do you keep using this misleading terminology and referring to NxtFoundation and NxtOrganization as &quot;private groups&quot; as if this committee structure is different? NxtOrg has opened it's doors to anyone on this forum numerous times, we are IDENTICALLY open as this committee structure. Unless someone sends a message to every adress on the blockchain and use Voting System to decide, it would be impossible to draw a distinction between what is happening in this committee vs the organization vs the foundation.<br /><br /><br />And while I share your concern for the long term development of the platform Nxt, more importantly is actually the fact that very few people use Nxt. Nxt has a lot of great technology, which is why projects like yours and mine use it, but unless we manage to capture new people from OUTSIDE Nxt, it wont matter. Ignore the crash and burnt value and volume of Nxt, Just check the forum stats, check the blockchain stats, check google analytics stats. The conclusion is not even up for discussion: Nxt is dying. There is a reason this committee project, like Damelon put it, ended up a total failure: no one cares anymore. Just a few months back when we started Nxt Organization there was a ton of people engaged in the debate and people signing up, this does not happen anymore.<br /><br /><br />Having the best technology does not mean jack shit, adoption is everything. There are numerous examples of sub-par technology having monopolies simply due to adoption vs superior technologies not having any users. Nxt became yet another such example. I've been saying this since day 1 and nothing has changed. Nxt is infected with this idiotic mindstate and doesn't change and consequently doesn't grow. Developers, marketers, users, everyone is abandoning Nxt at a steady rate. Unless something radically changes in the next 3 months I predict Nxt is dead by May<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>hello emule<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />you became a troll too James?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>yup! I am your personal troll. I dont like you. I dont like how you behave. you use your sockpuppets, it is dishonest, yet you claim to be the great positive force for NXT, when all you do it hurt it.<br /><br />many people left NXT specifically because of you and your abrasive manner. Since you sound halfway credible and you are spouting nonsense,&nbsp; I need to discredit you so that people wont start worrying needlessly.<br /><br />Remember when you were pushing real hard for Isle of Mann crytpo paradise? And I said, that is the wrong path and there is no assurance that one day the bigger fiat govts wouldnt squeeze the IoM to cave into their desires. Within a few months, what happened? where is the Isle of Mann crypto paradise? So you were wrong on that one, but you keep coming back with doom and gloom. <br /><br />It is curious that both you and emule are back at the same time. I just put two and two together<br /><br />James

Our reputation within the crypto world is at an all time high, and MS is about to make a lot of alts completely obsolete.<br /><br />I really can't see how you can justify your post, we are in a strong position right now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not being negative towards Nxt technology or Nxt in an isolated view. But I am seeing the bigger picture of crypto and Nxts place within said picture and to me it's not looking good. I would be delighted, absolutely delighted to be proven wrong, as that would mean I am set for life. But I am able to ignore my own wishful-thinking biases and look at the facts:<br /><br />Users = down<br />Developers = down<br />Marketers = down<br />Price = down<br />Volume = down<br />Competitors = up<br /><br /><br />I also know of some really good news for Nxt that will be coming out in the next weeks, including some really cool projects that has sprung up recently by genius minds, but my thinking has been proven right for a year, so I don't expect it to suddenly shift unless we actually DO something about it, no. Which is why I advocate for giving the Nxt DIRECTLY to those that can and more importantly WANT to push Nxt forward. Like I said in that other post, if we manage to get some wind back in our sails that could cause a positive snowballing effect for Nxt. But this wont happen just because we have some cool technology. Nxt has had the best platform for a year, no one really gives a shit about that. This is just how reality works. Like I said on the good old next forum owned by Graviton last December: <br /><br />&quot;There is a Mozart playing the piano in his basement somewhere that you'll never be aware of, yet everyone has heard of Justin Bieber&quot;<br /><br /><br />Marketing = adoption, adoption = growth<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I know, we should all just send all our NXT to you since you are the smartest one around here.<br />what is your NXT address, I will send you all my NXT<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes James, exactly. Except for the fact that I have already stated that I would get exactly 0% of this money and don't want any of the money, I want the money to go to those who are working in the NxtFoundation and NxtOrganization. Trolling is not your suit<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You are making the FUD for NXT while claiming you have done all these wonderful things for NXT.<br /><br />Please name all the wonderful things. I can think of the fiat gateway project you wanted 5 million NXT for, what was it called? bithaus, no nxthaus. Yes, fantastic part of the NXT ecosystem you have brought for us.<br /><br />You advocating spending a lot of money, that is the solution to everything to you.<br /><br />James

Adopt a MS currency with huge user base &amp; fair distribution and spread it into the world<br />2.) Refocus from cryptocurrency to service provider. This means focusing much more on AE and stuff like that and allow other, successful currencies to allow our service. <br /><br />We all know that NXT distribution is too shitty<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>what is the burn rate of NXT?<br />what people that dont understand crypto do is to apply real world thinking to it. This is not optimal. Contrary to what emules are saying the usage levels are actually going up. In spite of all the gloom and doom talk, what AE platform is getting more actual usage than all others combined?<br /><br />So, to say the end is coming in 6 months to the platform that has succeeded more than all the other asset platforms combined, well I use the term &quot;emule&quot; for a reason.<br /><br />With all the regulations and most the other platforms within reach of the regulations, which platform is positioned to survive?<br /><br />Now please think about this. At any moment in time a company that wants to do a crypto project will make a decision which platform to use. Maybe network effect forces people to keep making Windows versions, but all developers are praying for the day when it stops being a viable platform. And linux survived for many years, cuz it has constantly been the best platform to create new projects on.<br /><br />The day NXT tech is not the best crypto platform for new projects, that is the day it will begin to stop growing. Now this is a complex issue, so you can choose to listen to emule and uniquorn who has achieved exactly what for NXT? Or me.<br /><br />Your choice.<br /><br />James

Our reputation within the crypto world is at an all time high, and MS is about to make a lot of alts completely obsolete.<br /><br />I really can't see how you can justify your post, we are in a strong position right now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not being negative towards Nxt technology or Nxt in an isolated view. But I am seeing the bigger picture of crypto and Nxts place within said picture and to me it's not looking good. I would be delighted, absolutely delighted to be proven wrong, as that would mean I am set for life. But I am able to ignore my own wishful-thinking biases and look at the facts:<br /><br />Users = down<br />Developers = down<br />Marketers = down<br />Price = down<br />Volume = down<br />Competitors = up<br /><br /><br />I also know of some really good news for Nxt that will be coming out in the next weeks, including some really cool projects that has sprung up recently by genius minds, but my thinking has been proven right for a year, so I don't expect it to suddenly shift unless we actually DO something about it, no. Which is why I advocate for giving the Nxt DIRECTLY to those that can and more importantly WANT to push Nxt forward. Like I said in that other post, if we manage to get some wind back in our sails that could cause a positive snowballing effect for Nxt. But this wont happen just because we have some cool technology. Nxt has had the best platform for a year, no one really gives a shit about that. This is just how reality works. Like I said on the good old next forum owned by Graviton last December: <br /><br />&quot;There is a Mozart playing the piano in his basement somewhere that you'll never be aware of, yet everyone has heard of Justin Bieber&quot;<br /><br /><br />Marketing = adoption, adoption = growth<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I know, we should all just send all our NXT to you since you are the smartest one around here.<br />what is your NXT address, I will send you all my NXT<br /><br />James

How much? How often? Hourly based or project based? Also, there still need to be a vote held on the self nominated members here. Else it would be just a minority (by 1 person, the self nominated user) decision. <br /><br /><br />For me the best option is the splitting of 25% for NxtOrg, 25% NxtFoundation and 50% for developers held by pouncer and neer.g. New group formations always take a long time until they really take of. The two already established groups (NxtOrg&amp;NxtFound) are here already and working. Why take the risk of another group, which might not work at all? <br /><br />This is my opinion and not the opinion of the NxtOrg. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I will work without any pay for this.<br /><br />I am against pre-allocating any funds to any private groups. the committee should evaluate any and all external and internal proposals and decide on a case by case basis.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why do you keep using this misleading terminology and referring to NxtFoundation and NxtOrganization as &quot;private groups&quot; as if this committee structure is different? NxtOrg has opened it's doors to anyone on this forum numerous times, we are IDENTICALLY open as this committee structure. Unless someone sends a message to every adress on the blockchain and use Voting System to decide, it would be impossible to draw a distinction between what is happening in this committee vs the organization vs the foundation.<br /><br /><br />And while I share your concern for the long term development of the platform Nxt, more importantly is actually the fact that very few people use Nxt. Nxt has a lot of great technology, which is why projects like yours and mine use it, but unless we manage to capture new people from OUTSIDE Nxt, it wont matter. Ignore the crash and burnt value and volume of Nxt, Just check the forum stats, check the blockchain stats, check google analytics stats. The conclusion is not even up for discussion: Nxt is dying. There is a reason this committee project, like Damelon put it, ended up a total failure: no one cares anymore. Just a few months back when we started Nxt Organization there was a ton of people engaged in the debate and people signing up, this does not happen anymore.<br /><br /><br />Having the best technology does not mean jack shit, adoption is everything. There are numerous examples of sub-par technology having monopolies simply due to adoption vs superior technologies not having any users. Nxt became yet another such example. I've been saying this since day 1 and nothing has changed. Nxt is infected with this idiotic mindstate and doesn't change and consequently doesn't grow. Developers, marketers, users, everyone is abandoning Nxt at a steady rate. Unless something radically changes in the next 3 months I predict Nxt is dead by May<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>hello emule

How much? How often? Hourly based or project based? Also, there still need to be a vote held on the self nominated members here. Else it would be just a minority (by 1 person, the self nominated user) decision. <br /><br /><br />For me the best option is the splitting of 25% for NxtOrg, 25% NxtFoundation and 50% for developers held by pouncer and neer.g. New group formations always take a long time until they really take of. The two already established groups (NxtOrg&amp;NxtFound) are here already and working. Why take the risk of another group, which might not work at all? <br /><br />This is my opinion and not the opinion of the NxtOrg. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I will work without any pay for this.<br /><br />I am against pre-allocating any funds to any private groups. the committee should evaluate any and all external and internal proposals and decide on a case by case basis.<br /><br />James

It's near 10% per year for the original investors (1 JLH was below 1 NXT) and 2.4 % for the actual investors (1 JLH = 4 NXT).<br />And it's actual revenue only from 2 or 3 assets. We can hope more and more in the future.<br /><br />Why the gambling solution ?

For sure this solution could be interesting because the total of the dividend can be very high :&nbsp; 1 JLH = 0.1 NXT or more.<br /><br />- You can use the cash in NXT to support the NAV with a buy order.
