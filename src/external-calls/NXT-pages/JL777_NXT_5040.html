					for people who are skeptical of this, please look at <a href="http://www.payexpo.com/Content/Sponsors-and-Exhibitors" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.payexpo.com/Content/Sponsors-and-Exhibitors</a><br /><br />This is full of banks and tech companies that deal with money<br />If this is not the demographic for NXT, what is?<br /><br />NXT is the cryptocurrency partner for the whole event!<br />Do you realize that EVERYBODY that has heard of crypto will now assume that NXT is the best crypto for payments, not any other. This already is very worthwhile. Funding is 90% complete.<br /><br />Just 1 deal from this will justify all the costs.Does anybody doubt that cointropolis wont get one deal?<br /><br />What if that deal is with Barclays bank where they agree to implement a coinbase type of system into their payment service?<br /><br />Skeptics, please reserve negativity until after the trade show. Constructive feedback always welcome, but positive state of mind is very important. <br />There are no guarantees in life, but there is a guarantee that you wont succeed if you dont try<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I revise my statement about not so tech audience, there will be a lot of CTO types for the secondary companies (the ones trying to sell their services to Barclays) that could very well be captivated by all the tech other than payments that NXT has. Definitely need at least one tech type in attendance!<br />

BTC, NXT, anything but DOGE will all be the same.<br />No need for blockchains, decentralization, etc. It will just confuse. Keep it simple.<br />What is the main benefit for the payment guys to use crypto?<br />Notice the question is crypto in general,not NXT. We take the presumptive position that if you are going to use crypto, of course it will be NXT. What else, some energy wasting PoW coin that uses enough electricity everyday to power London. Yes the same london in the tradeshow<br /><br />Now maybe 1% of the people will want to look under the hood a bit, but they wont be the decision makers at that show and probably not worth the time when there are execs in charge of deciding how billions of USD in payments are made<br /><br />NXT is the future of money<br />Payments are about sending money<br /><br />Clearly since NXT is the only crypto there,it must be the most advanced and best for payments!<br /><br />James

I am glad of that, especially the long term one, like the wiki and the speakers program.<br /><br />I will hand over my tasks to the other members. Whether or not a replacement is selected and how that is done, will be their decision.<br /><br />I will inform neer.g that he will have a new spokesperson to ask for the release of funds once he or she has been selected.<br /><br />I am happy that we have been able to accomplish what we did and will continue to work &quot;freelance&quot; within Nxt Marketing as needed. Hell, I might even propose something to the MC in the future.<br /><br />Thanks to all the people who have applied to us and supported us.

I think most votes have been pretty lopsided, so I am hoping I will be rarely needed.

I think this has some relevance here, at least to me, as it concerns one of the taboos in our community: The coin. NXT the payment solution. If you have patience then read through it, if not… jump till after the second quote.<br /><br />Bitcoinpaul:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">People really like the original 'logo' (see attached image), especially because the chain is presented in its full glory.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I too failed being clear enough about that when the coin images were created. Note to self: We must be sharp and to the point in EVERY matter here! Sorry Michael, now let's get it right.<br /><br />I love the original logo. I voted for it and cheered when it won. But the text is unreadable from a distance. IMO it needs to reach the eye instantly, at least when used like on the payexpo site, where banners are (at best) only scanned by the visitor. Later, the logo-chain will stand for itself. When Nxt is known.<br /><br />It seems wrong to me, that Nxt and NXT should have the same logo. I guess that's why I didn't scream STOP, when you amputated the chain on the coin images. Bitcoinpaul said it: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Could you make it with and without &quot;Cryptocurrency&quot;? Because it is much more...</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly. These coins confuse the picture, that's what stops me. The chain is Nxt, and Nxt is not a coin. Coins are different, they will live on our blockchain, and myth demands them to be round (what a joke in this day and age), so ppl can understand that &quot;this is actual money&quot;. This image of a simple coin is so far from the Nxt idea and core as it can be, IMHO. We are a monetary system, yes, and we will expand from that. We're not some bloody altcoin. That's what we have spent months to prove. <br /><br />That's why &quot;NXT / NxtCoin&quot; is not my main interest. I'm actually waiting for the &quot;real&quot; Nxt currency to be created on top of Nxt, and then it will have my full attention. <br /><br />IMO we kick and scream to hold on to that &quot;Coin&quot; because many Nxters are traders. So coins are still what we're familiar with. Now will the value of Nxt grow if it's not a &quot;coin&quot;? - Let's make it a coin AND &quot;so much more&quot;… <br />Maybe this is gonna work, I don't know. But to me this &quot;coin-image&quot; of Nxt is a mental barrier that needs to be smashed, just like the &quot;coins are round&quot;-image in Average J's heads. We cannot claim to be the golden calve of crypto innovation, and at the same time hang on to being a simple (alt)coin, IMHO. <br /><br />Why haven't anyone made that official &quot;Nxt Coin&quot;? I dunno. Because we have invested in Nxt? What would make a NxtCoin &quot;official&quot;, if it's not issued by BCNext? IMO, that it's backed by the community. Ppl need to understand that we have that power, and what we build on top of Nxt will benefit the price of Nxt. <br /><br />I remember CfB saying some time ago, that he personally would invest in other coins and use Nxt as storage. This may make sense when AE has inbuilt multigateway to other blockchains (BTC). <br /><br />I'm sad to say that tomorrow I'm forced by RL to be offline. I'll check in on mobile, I just can't mess around with uploading files to nxtforum or the mediazip. Well, maybe in the afternoon. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />We should create that coin design. NXT, the simple crypto currency. With the chain. I guess we don't have time to plan a fork and make that parallel chain the coin, so let's try to do magic with what we have at this moment. <br /><br />Maybe I'm the one who has to break down a mental barrier. Maybe NXT makes sense, being part of Nxt, the coin that is also a protocol. I'm pretty much into things here, and this is the main thing I still don't understand. I'm sure I'm not alone. Could someone be kind to explain to me in clear terms what is going on with this? I promise to add it as next week's &quot;Words of Wisdom&quot;. IF we are a simple coin PLUS an innovative crypto system, could we call the coin NxtCoin and not NXT at least, just for marketing purposes? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I would imagine that it makes sense to tweak the basic logo for each use case.<br />For a payments trade show, I think that NXT as the coin used for payments without all the NXT is a platform, yada yada might be the easiest and therefore most effective to convey. Its payment trade show, why not &quot;Pay with NXT&quot; as a theme?<br /><br />However, I am just a simple C programmer and not a graphic designer<br /><br />James

This whole TXTcoin/PayExpo thing is becoming a drama that absolutely no-one really needs.<br /><br /><strong>My personal position: </strong><br />PayExpo is not a good fit for NXT yet. Maybe in 6 months/one year but not now. We stand a good chance of looking like a bunch of farmboys in the big city, completely out of our depth. Lets build up our conference game a bit first.<br /><br />NXT is not a good fit for PayExpo. We have very little to offer these guys yet, apart from a lot of blue-sky plans and great ideas. Again, if we build up our experience and contacts with payment processors in the crypto-world (CoinBase springs to mind) we can get an idea of what to offer the PayExpo crowd.<br /><br />PayExpo is insanely expensive right now. We can have sponsorship level presence at 4 or 5 smaller conferences for the same price. Again, wait 6 months and the price will (hopefully) be a lot more acceptable, assuming NXT has risen.<br /><br />We are only 3 weeks away from going live at PayExpo, and although we could probably pull a reasonable effort together, we could do a lot better job if we had more time to prepare and recruit. <br /><br />TXTcoins has now pulled out (or was never going to go in the first place,I'm confused on this point) so now NXT has almost nothing to present at the conf.<br /><br /><br /><strong>So whats the situation now, EvilDave?</strong><br /><br />TBH: I don't really know. We seem to be committed to attending a conference that is completely out of our league, that most people with conference experience do not want to attend, with nothing to present and our assumed partner not coming. A certain amount of NXT has been raised, but certainly not enough to pay for it.<br /><br />I'm not going to play the game of trying to figure out who is responsible for this mess, and laying blame, because I think that the guys who started this initiative did so in good faith, there are no scammers here.(probably)<br />TXTcoins seem to be genuine enough, though their Internet and corporate presence is a little sketchy. They do have a real product, and have raised (with Salsa's help) funding for themselves via AE, so I've got no real problems there. <br />Communication could have gone a lot better with TXTcoins, tbh, I did get a very scammy feeling from their forum posts...but that may be because we live in a world full of scam artists right now, and everyone with dodgy spelling looks suspicious. <br />Even without PayExpo, TXTcoins could certainly attend further crypto conferences with us, get their product some exposure to the crypto-world<br />Salsa seems to be doing his best for NXT, as usual, but his idea of lead times on conferences is a bit optimistic, as is his idea of the level at which NXT can play right now. <br /><br /><strong>Solutions:</strong><br /><br />Lets back out of PayExpo (if that is still possible) and ask the donators of the funds pledged if they would be good with using their NXT for a series of conferences over the summer.&nbsp; (I have 3 good possibliities in mind, that I think I can organise/attend, starting with BitFin, Dublin on July 3)<br /><br />More conferences will mean in the&nbsp; long term: more exposure, more opportunities, repeated contacts and more chances for NXT'ers to attend and practice their pitches. We will have time to develop a much more effective presence in the crypto-world, and to form partnerships within the crypto-world with an eye on moving on out into the mainstream. Once we start seeing the first little signs of mainstream adoption, we can move up to PayExpo level events.<br /><br />Its not too late to salvage this situation, and move on.<br />.<br />So, what do you think, people?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I say NXT is decentralized.<br />Why not decentralized tradeshow teams too!<br /><br />I hereby authorize up to 100,000 NXT in matching funds from NXTcommunityfund for these EvilDave shows. <br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I realize I control the tech half of NXTcommunityfund, but I feel that almost all tech can be financed via assets, while trade show marketing cost is a truly horizontal thing that benefits the entire community. If anybody has objections to my supporting trade shows, speak up now
