						<span class="smalltext">&#171;&nbsp;<strong>on:</strong> May 14, 2014, 12:36:20 pm&nbsp;&#187;</span>
					</div>
					<div class="list_posts">
					There are a total of 1 million InstantDEX assets, each asset represents .0001%<br /><br />The goal of InstantDEX is to offer realtime trading of NXT, NXT assets and other cryptos. It will earn fees from commissions on the trades. By keeping costs low by using a decentralized infrastructure, it is expected to be able to distribute approximately half of revenues to asset holders. <br /><br />InstantDEX had some significant technical challenges, the biggest being that direct communication between two peers is somewhat difficult. Also, thanks to mczarnek, the evil forger attack was identified and prevented. Once I am done with the low level API, it will be in Wesley's capable hands to make it as easy (maybe easier!) to use than any centralized exchange.<br /><br />Except there wont be any centralized servers, there wont even be an actual website as the GUI will be running locally. Just direct peer to peer trading in realtime.<br /><br />I have officially announced this yet, but I will be integrating NXTsubatomic and NXTatomic into InstantDEX. While these are not realtime trading mechanisms, they are related to trading and it makes sense for them to be part of InstantDEX. A nice bonus for all the InstantDEX holders.<br /><br />The monetization model is very clear and simple. The centralized exchanges charge 0.2% to 0.5% for each trade, plus additional fees for withdrawal. InstantDEX will not have any fees for withdrawals and the commissions will be set to 0.1% at first. Keep in mind that this is charged to both buyer and seller so the total revenue will be 0.2%. This will be the lowest in the industry and coupled with the decentralized nature will provide a strong competitive advantage.<br /><br />I expect InstantDEX to gain significant market share of the overall crypto trading market. The exact market share is not something I can accurately predict now.<br /><br />Another point of note, there wont be any fees charged for changing a bid or ask. In addition to the wait time till the next block, that using NXT AE by itself has, there is a min tx fee charged everytime a bid or ask is changed. Combining InstantDEX with NXT AE is the superior solution.<br /><br />As soon as multigateway is deployed, InstantDEX will be able to be tested. NXT(sub)atomic will probably not be ready at first.<br /><br />James<br />

					NXTventure makes private investments in promising enterprises and adds value to each investment by proactively integrating it into NXTservices to add a valuable new service for the NXTcommunity. NXTventure will pay monthly dividends in the assets it acquires, net of trading activities during the launch period. This means NXTventure asset will generate a stream of new assets as it launches them. <br /><br />I am pleased to announce CoinTropololis_JustaBit will join the NXTventure team. NXTventure is only interested in working with the most promising enterprises and we expect there to only be one new listing per month.<br /><br />As the leading issuer of NXT assets, I will be able to advise the proper strategy for listing and market making.<br />As the developer of NXTservices, I will be able to help integrate exciting new features into the NXT community while at the same time enhancing the value of the companies NXTventure invests in. If you are concerned about regulatory issues, NXTventure can provide a buffer by privately investing and issuing assets that represent that private investment. Sales of these assets via AE provide additional insulation as all asset sales are through an open market. NXTventure is not based in usa or europe, which might have stringent regulations.<br /><br />To qualify for investment, your enterprise needs to bring significant new value to the NXT community.<br /><br />If you are interested in purchasing NXTventure assets, they are still some available via AE. Stay tuned for announcements for the first NXTventure listing<br /><br />James<br />

					each MGW asset represents .0001% of multigateway multigateway will generate minimal fees from deposits and withdraws of cryptos into NXT AE. It uses a separate multisig acct for each depositor. It will have ongoing server costs and to minimize the cost of depositing and withdrawing crypto assets into NXT, it will keep fees as low as possible. Currently its projected revenue source will be via auctions for listing altcoins and altcoin giveaways. Such revenues received net of operating costs will be distributed to asset holders. multigateway isnt a non-profit, but it also isnt designed to be a massive profit generator. Any investment in multigateway will help cover operating costs and help the NXT community.<br /><br />The long term strategy of MGW is to provide a low cost, secure and reliable way to deposit crypto into NXT AE. I view this as a mission critical function. Rather than charge fees to pay for operating costs, I decided to raise funds by selling assets. The initial market price appeared to be around 5 to 7.5, so I priced it at 2.5<br /><br />I gave bonuses to all that paid more than 2.5 as I didnt want the people who most wanted MGW to suffer at all!<br /><br />Until NXT AE is firmly established as the best way to trade crypto, I am not planning on monetizing the usage of MGW. It will be a marketshare play. Now, down the road when there is millions of dollars of transactions going on, maybe I will add a small fee with plenty of announcement so people that dont like it will be able to withdraw before the new fee structure goes in place.<br /><br />So, if you were lucky enough to get MGW at the 2.5 price, please help make MGW dominate the industry. Then I will convert MGW from a quasi-nonprofit to a profit based enterprise. I cannot estimate the value of MGW as a profit making entity, especially with a large future customer base. I can say that it should be a bit more than 2.5 NXT per asset.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I will reduce my personal stake in MGW to 10% via the 2.5 NXT firesale and giveways to key community and MGW contributors.

You would want to automate the transferring of assets. This would be a nice project for NXTcoinsco to do.<br />All I would need is the NXT acct #'s to send how much NEM asset to. Will need to limit to ~100 tx per block, so 3000 transfers would be done in half an hour.<br /><br />If you want to do it yourself, just issue a NEM asset then write a program to loop through the list and issue transferAsset API call<br /><br />James

I believe this might be the largest transaction on any of the distributed exchanges,but not sure if masterxchange or XCP did something larger.<br /><br />Maybe marketing wants to do a press thing on this?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I believe you should reconsider the way you place your Asks...&nbsp; 20% of NXTventure has just been sucked up by one person/account at the lowest price offered...&nbsp; you're offering batches of 10000 shares at increasing prices...&nbsp; IF ANYTHING the 200000 brick should have been offered at the highest available Ask...&nbsp; just saying...&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/rolleyes.gif" alt="&#58;&#58;&#41;" title="Roll Eyes" class="smiley" /><br /><br />The only way I can see this 2 million NXT transaction NOT hurting NXTventure in the end...&nbsp; is if it was placed by you and/or any other of the assets' issuers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The early bird gets the worm<br /><br />My philosophy is to help others make money, that way I will end up with a lot of people I have made money for <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />until there is a significant chunk of funds an enterprise like NXTventure cant do anything, so there is a good premium paid for that initial infusion. Now that NXTventure has enough capital to fund the type of issuers I am targeting, I made a price ladder. You will notice it goes up step by step. The lower prices are available only as long as they are there.<br /><br />I am not trying to squeeze out every possible NXT of profit, my goals are less capitalistic. I want as many people as possible to make a lot of NXT and to bring in people outside of NXT into NXT. money has a habit of doing that. My goal is to help create a vibrant NXT economy, with software I write, with companies I raise funds for, with the investors that I help make profits, with coins that I help others make, etc.<br /><br />NXT is nowhere near the zero sum game capitalism where its dog eat dog for every scrap. Now, everybody can win, we just need to keep expanding the scope of NXT. Having a pseudo investment bank like NXTventure is one of the pieces to the overall puzzle. MGW (multigateway) is another, so is InstantDEX, bithaus, NXTcoinsco, anonymization, even lovable nodecoin <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James

Transaction fees?<br />I need to raise enough to make sure server costs are covered for the foreseable future.<br />This will allow me to set the multigateway fee to close to zero for people who use it.<br />The alternative you propose would require an industry normal fee for using multigateway. I want to set it to the cost of the txfee.<br />it is my opinion that multigateway will have more value to the community if it had as low fee structure as possible<br /><br />I wanted to find the market value and then discount it severely so that everybody who purchases it would have reasonable expectations of making a small profit for their support.<br /><br />Also people who get stuff for free dont tend to value it as much. I am giving it away to community members that have contributed, like the committee members and the people that have helped me with multigateway development.<br /><br />I am planning on giving away about half the MGW assets (already gave away 25%) to people that have contributed and selling 40% at half market price to NXT community members. I just dont see the value in giving it to random people who post &quot;interested&quot;<br /><br />James<br />

					The market price for MGW appears to be a bit above 5 as whenever I put some for sale, it disappears pretty fast.<br />I want to reduce the price to 2.5<br />anybody that purchased at above 2.5, please PM me, I will send to you bonus assets so your price is also 2.5<br />Between compiles I will post more at 2.5 if the current batch has sold out<br />I want there to be even distribution, so please dont just keep buying it up.<br />I know I cant enforce that, but I want MGW to be community asset.<br /><br />James
