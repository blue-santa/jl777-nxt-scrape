So by spending it for a lotto, arguably it reduces the compounding for the long term holders. However the lack of liquidity and discount to NAV was quite significant and we feel having a monthly lotto for 50,000 to 100,000 NXT would make JLH that much more interesting.<br /><br />In fact due to the initial lotto being 175,000 NXT worth, it is actually boosting the value of the JLH purchased by 10%<br />Technically the disposition of the cash dividends that JLH gets was not precisely specified, so arguably this is within the asset definition. However, I want to be sure it is not upsetting to the existing JLH holders.<br /><br />If they prefer the way it used to be, we can cancel the lotto.<br /><br />James

					In order to address the JLH trading below NAV problem, we now have libertynow actively market making and also we have devised a JLH lotto plan.<br /><br />However, this will use the cash dividends that JLH is receiving from the various assets it holds. This is too small to make much impact if given to all assetholders, but in the form of a lottery prize becomes quite meaningful. In fact, our calculations show that it boosts the value of JLH by about 10% immediately, not to mention the increased liquidity.<br /><br />However, it does use (currently) about 0.1% per month of cashflow that would otherwise be able to be invested into more assets. <br /><br />My assessment is that there is no point to increase NAV when it is trading at big discounts to it, so until this is fixed, we are better off to use this small percentage to increase volumes and reduce the discount to NAV.<br /><br />If the JLH assetholders are against this lotto plan to boost liquidity and help it trade near NAV, then we can cancel it, but then you cant complain if it ends up at a discount to NAV.<br /><br />James

These people are reachable at the right conferences, trade shows, or maybe directly via PM. Any serious decision maker will be studying the tech options available and choose the one that solves their problems the best.<br /><br />So having better tech, better support engineers (a form of tech) and better tech documentation to help others integrate NXT. This is the things that will help, along with reference implementations of the standard things people will want to do. Again more tech.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This aligns completely with how I think what Nxt is and how it should present itself in the world.<br /><br />In fact, we both made the exactly the same list <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Edit: I will state here that unless someone injects me secretly with a significant amount of forbidden substances, I will not behave like Ballmer.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You got me. I cheated and just used your list, cuz it made a lot of sense<br /><br />There is a big gap between what the core does and useful reference applications.<br />Let us think like a chip developer. Clearly the actual silicon chip is needed. However, a chip without the application notes (a specific use case that actually does something useful) is usually not adopted much. Also having up to date tech docs helps, but the most helpful are the application notes that go as far as provide a circuit diagram (and machine readable so you can just send it off to be manufacturered), along with required firmware, etc.<br /><br />The companies still need to worry about stuff like what type of box to put it in, how much to skimp on the power supply, the color of the case, cooling fans, and marketing. But they can take a black box ready to go and customize it (or not)<br /><br />This is why MS is so cool. It is just a small step away from those websites that say &quot;send us 1 BTC and we will make a coin for you&quot;. With MS, we can just put that page on nxt.org and say, fill in this form and fund the acct with NXT and presto! you have a new coin customized for you.<br /><br />So by NXT devs, I include the peoples that are making such things, not just the inner guts deep core guys, but without the inner guts deep core guys, there wont be any reference applications to make<br /><br />James

I trust J a lot.....but his presence on the CFC could open us and him up to all kinds of accusations about conflicts of interest, as well as being a distraction from SuperNET.&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br />Having said that, I'm not going to rule that J can't stand for the CFC, even if I think it's a bad idea.<br /><br />I do agree with J in broad principle: setting all the money aside for core devs is a good idea, and will benefit every member of the community.<br />But we'll still need a Committee to administer the dev payments........<br /><br />Some NXT should be allocated for unforeseen expenses, and some would be also useful for effective marketing.<br />60:20:20 split, (devs, expenses, marketing) sounds good to me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I only resubmitted as I saw that some private groups are asking for just being granted the NXT and this does not seem right at all. So as long as we arent going to just give the funds to private organizations, then I dont need to be in the committee. In fact if people are considering giving funds to some private groups, why not just grant it to me? I have been known to achieve some good results.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. We certainly cant do anything that will give anybody a reason to FUD against NXT. After all nobody has done that to NXT yet and we certainly cant survive if people start making the FUD against us.

Next to nothing.<br />Microsoft has it all.<br /><br />The only market share where Linux wins is in the web servers segment, because it's so far better on the most common needs.<br /><br />Tech is great. If not marketed, it's just not used.<br /><br />James: Heard of OSI? It was supposed to be the future of Networks. Then TCP/IP arrived. Not better, technically. Just <em>sold </em>better.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>OSI wasnt even a technology platform was it? It seemed more a way to make the platforms and TCP/IP is almost an instance that follows OSI, so not sure if it makes much sense to compare the two. TCP/IP violates the OSI guidelines though, cuz it makes it more practical.<br /><br />Was there some working tech that used OSI? OSI is some committee created layering to allow for independent development of different layers, at least that is my understanding. But there is no OSInetwork. So how can you say that TCP/IP isnt better?<br /><br />As far as microsoft windows. Really? You are comparing marketing NXT to marketing Windows? MSFT convinced IBM to adopt MS-DOS as the OS for the PC. This was a business deal that gave them an effective monopoly over the OS market with the giant network effect. How much did MSFT spend on marketing to get the DOS deal with IBM? Do you really equate the NXT position now as anything like MSFT situation with DOS?<br /><br />I claim in these two examples, the solution that had the working tech won. TCP/IP won over OSI, cuz TCP/IP actually worked and had a real network. MSFT got the deal with IBM because they had the tech at the right time.<br /><br />NXT needs to be presented to the decision makers about crypto platforms. These people are reachable at the right conferences, trade shows, or maybe directly via PM. Any serious decision maker will be studying the tech options available and choose the one that solves their problems the best.<br /><br />So having better tech, better support engineers (a form of tech) and better tech documentation to help others integrate NXT. This is the things that will help, along with reference implementations of the standard things people will want to do. Again more tech.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. NXT is a lot more like TCP/IP in that it isnt some grandiose abstract specification on how things should be done, but like TCP/IP it is a working example that people can build on.<br />

The projects built on this platform would then have a more product oriented approach and different projects can allocate 1% to 100% on tech as they see fit.<br /><br />So, if NXT is a platform like the internet is a platform, then what good is having the IP protocol running marketing campaigns? The products built on NXT should be running the campaigns.<br /><br />Since I was disqualified from this committee due to my involvement in the various NXT oriented projects making it impossible for me to not have some relation to anything funded in NXT. Now these new organizations are fine, I have nothing against them, but there are some in these organizations that are using newbie handles. So how are others to know what other projects they are associated with? Especially if there are projects which also have newbie handles associated with them.<br /><br />If it is a problem that I might influence my decisions based on personal financial interests, then that standard should be applied to all. But this creates some unsolvable issues...<br /><br />Hence I strongly suggest 100% to NXT core devs and you can make whatever committees to manage what devs get what. Or maybe CfB's idea of sending to genesis wasnt so bad after all. The last thing I wanted when I rescued these funds from being burned was it to become a source of contention.<br /><br />Some might argue the wisdom of 100% to NXT core devs, but I think we can all agree that this is a pure solution. It wont make everybody happy, but nothing will. And at least we will get more tech for the projects that build on the NXT platform<br /><br />James
