					I decided to add support for MScoins even though fees probably will limit its usage. They are just so similar to assets it is a matter of a few small changes.<br /><br />One thing that I am not sure of is if transferCurrency will always work. I think there might be some combinations of types that prevent transfer. if there is some definitive way to know if a transfer is valid without actually submitting the txbytes, then I can enable such support.<br /><br />If there is an InstantDEX orderbook, the it would be possible to autoconvert part of it to cover txfees. alternative is making some sort of offchain methods for doing internal trading, but that is a lot of work and unless something like that is needed for pangea, i dont expect to be doing it anytime soon<br /><br />James

					cross post from supernet slack:<br /><br />so no worries about using InstantDEX too much. At saturation levels of 100 tx per block, I estimate NXT is worth 10x more on a cashflow basis as it will yield 10%<br />what other investment would give interest rate like that and have all the potential NXT has?<br />so no promise that we get to 100MM market cap, but if crypto is based on cashflow a rough metric would be extra million dollars NXT market cap for each tx per block InstantDEX does<br /><br />with 5NXT per trade, the direct revenues for InstantDEX become quite ridiculous, so it cant possibly be true. Well it is contingent on a rather crazy high 100 trades per block, but at that levels InstantDEX will have revenues on par with best any of the mining assets ever did, but instead of just being a return of capital it is from organic new revenues, from a rapidly growing business<br /><br />btcddev also had some great feedback, so I will be adding auction support and even private encrypted chatroom support to the InstantDEX API<br />for auctions it would be a trustless process only for pure crypto auctions, anything real world would require trusting the seller but this is normal for any sort of auction site<br /><br />I also wanted to explain a bit about hybrid orderbooks as I found out it is not common knowledge<br />many people have heard of arbitrage and arbitrage bots<br />for example let us say there is BTCD/NXT and NXT/BTC markets<br />well these really do exist so it is easy to think about this exact thing!<br />so the price of BTCD/NXT is going up and down and so does NXT/BTC price, now there is a third combination BTCD/BTC market and it also is going up and down<br />but these three are all related, eg. BTCD/NXT + NXT/BTC == BTCD/BTC<br />for example BTCD/NXT 100NXT and NXT/BTC 0.00005 -&gt; 1 BTCD -&gt; 100 NXT * 0.00005 = 0.005 BTC<br />so if the prices are 100 NXT for BTCD and 0.00005 BTC for NXT, then this is equivalent to 0.005 BTC for BTCD<br />what if any of the three is going above (or below) these prices?<br /><br />ARBITRAGE!!<br />so I am making the BTCD/BTC orderbook automatically have the (BTCD/NXT + NXT/BTC) orderbook and with one action you will be able to get the best price<br />with arbitrage, especially cross exchange, there are times where you can buy something at the exact time as you sell the opposite and can lock in a gain<br />this will require a pair of trades, one going through 2 orderbooks the balancing trade through 1<br />I think a 7.5 NXT fee for InstantDEX is well earned and the user is making some incremental profits<br /><br />James<br /><br />tl:dr once InstantDEX is live there is never need to trust any newbie asset issuer claiming the arbitrage bots as you can click and grab the arbitrage your self. Of course soon after I will release Tradebots that will do this clicking for you

Some percentage, 0.1%, 0.05% with 2.5NXT as minimum is much better.

Let them make their money! create liquidity for everyone else and liquidity alone has value. I have proof!<br /><br />LTC<br /><br />That is the only reason it has value. So with ridiculous low fees for trading, NXT gets much more liquidity, not to mention possible 10x in forging rates to where it becomes a factor in holding NXT.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. This crazy fixed price thing is for introductory period, eg. until it saturates the blockchain, which will spur the completion of EC and TF

That is ~0.5 BTC average trade size at 0.1% or 0.1 BTC and 0.5%, so based on this a flat rate is much simpler for everyone to understand and with the bias toward favoring the bigger traders, could attract a lot of volumes. which in turn will attract many other traders and also will naturally create smaller spreads.<br /><br />Your assertion that one trader cant create liquidity all by themselves is only correct if that liquidity doesnt attract any other traders. I am currently coding up hybrid orderbooks so people can automatically see an orderbook for A/C, even if such doesnt directly exist from A/B and B/A orderbooks. yes, this means people can directly purchase arbitrage pairs, but that will cost an extra 2.5 NXT as it goes through 2 orderbooks.<br /><br />Can you see a need for supporting 3 orderbooks in a single trade? Until we can support short selling or direct purchases of derivatives, I am not seeing much benefit for this.<br /><br />James

You are known for your work, which people can evaluate. Occam's razor suggests that since you have been here for so long and have produced so much added-value that you are not a scammer. However, there are many situations in which you may be tempted to embezzle from your assets <strong>because you can.</strong> There's no legal protection between the money people give you, and you. So your investors have no recourse. That is a fact which investors should be made aware of. Far from being a black mark, disclosing this somewhere is actually a sign of honesty.<br /><br />The main &quot;rule&quot; that your assets break from my standpoint is that they don't pay steady dividends <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> I am not known as a fan of startups. But I concede that all businesses were once startups. It's just not a phase of the game I personally favor. I'm not really a VC type of guy. I guess you could say I don't have what it takes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It is true that at any time I could have just disappeared with a couple millions dollars worth, but yet I havent and I wont. But I am probably the exception that proves the rule? Most people doing assets are mostly money motivated, while for me the money is secondary or even tertiary.<br /><br />I have promised to do the projects I said I would, so I will complete them and probably even more. The money is needed for paying other people to do the things I am not so good at. I am building a key part of the future crypto economy, at least the core part of it, but without the dozens of others connecting this core all the way to end user websites and everything in between, what I make would just be a technical curiosity.<br /><br />Connected to end users, then it will become what you like, eg. steady dividend producer. And since we substitute honor and trust for lawyers and legal system, and also there are no fancy office buildings but also sadly no cute assistants. However this reduces the cost overhead dramatically and this allows for much more rapid growth via compounding.<br /><br />SuperNET is a startup now and over the years it will keep having new things that are starting up, but after InstantDEX is live, then it changes to a revenue producer. At the high end of 100 trades per block, the txfees this will require will instantly make NXT worth over 10x more from a revenue basis.<br /><br />I know it sounds crazy, but that is the math. Currently NXT is earning &lt; 0.5% per year from forging. If the blocks are all full (~100 trades per block), this goes to around 10% per year. I wonder what market price the NXT will get if it is earning 10% on top of all that it already has? Also there would be no need to reduce txfees and the blockchain is a scarce resource and a penny is more than reasonable price for a slot in a block.<br /><br />James

Of course there can be exceptions to the rule. But this hopefully helps beginners who aren't experienced investors with NXT assets yet.<br /><br />One good rule (by Warren Buffett I think), is to invest in things you understand. I understand maybe 10-20% of SuperNET and invested in it, but Jinn I avoided, because I don't understand it at all. <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>AVOID newbie issuers.<br /></strong></span><br />This is &quot;unfair&quot; to any legit newbie, but it protects purchasers from serial scammers. A lot of these ponzis follow the same trajectory, eg. hype, building fake volume by buying own asset, sockpuppet army of adoring fan posts, some tentative purchases by real people, few percent dividends, get some real people to confirm dividends received, more hype, a few more dividends, then when the new real money stops coming in, the scammer disappears<br /><br />only to reappear the next week with yet another variation on &quot;buy my asset it has no risk and great returns&quot;<br /><br />So, filter out the serial scammer by avoiding newbie issuers. This is not any guarantee of success, but it does guarantee you dont fall for a newbie serial scammer<br /><br />James

I think SuperNET went from about 100 NXT /share to over 200. Maybe it's not worth it to invest &quot;now&quot;, but it was a good deal &quot;before&quot;. Maybe it will go to 400 or 500 NXT?

The only question is if it will average &lt;1 trade per block, or ~10 or ~100, so there are three orders of magnitude of possible outcomes. now sure how studying this will answer the key question of order levels. and in the short term this seems to be the primary effect on market price. of course long term the bigger question is what percentage of the crypto economy will be flowing through SuperNET and how big will the crypto economy be. This is a ~5year question.<br /><br />If your analysis that SuperNET has some sort of ceiling at 500 NXT, then it seems it is based just on &quot;its already doubled so it probably cant double more than once more&quot;, which might not be the right depth of analysis for something as multifaceted as SuperNET. <br /><br />James

With a sort of decentralised MGW there could be a BTC MS coin that is exchanged for a deposit of actual BTC.

Super cool would be to give the user an MSBTC address to match a BTC address. <br /><br />So, to &quot;lock&quot; some BTC one BTC holder can transfer BTC into a special BTC address that is managed by the decentralised MGW, and receives back MSBTC equal amount that can transfer to other MSBTC users or back into the BTC blockchain simply transferring the MSBTC to the decentralised MGW with a message with the BTC account to send the BTC to.<br /><br />So MSBTC can be exchanged inside the MS, and if the person needs to send them to a BTC user that has not MSBTC can do so creating a MSBTC account to this user with the funds inside, or transferring BTC back to the BTC universe <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />This creates a bridge to keep BTC alive as MSBTC.

					this glidesec reminds me of that scammer who had a magical money making system, but he disappeared... What was his name?<br /><br />on the small chance this is not a scam from a serial scammer:<br /><br />15% POWERtraders (Two separate traders with personal track record)<br />15% OkCoin Automated Bot (BTC longs/shorts)<br />15% Bitfinex Automated Bot (BTC longs/shorts)<br />20% Altcoin Trades (controlled by experienced POWERtraders)<br />12% Forex Trading (controlled by experienced Forex traders)<br />13% Fixed-Income security bonds<br />10% Stocks (Controlled by experience stock traders)<br /><br />this combines many different types of trading, none of which the glidesec has any competitive advantage. forex trading? yes this is funny joke. The resources required for profitable forex trading is quite large, else how to compete against multimillion (billion) dollar operations who are trimming microseconds of their order execution times by putting their servers in the same data center as the major forex houses. Not to mention the major forex houses.<br /><br />Fixed-Income security bonds. gee maybe this can make 10% if things go well. stocks. yup so easy to make money with stocks.<br /><br />altcoins and BTC long/short. Of course, it is so easy. <br />without specific details of how any of this isnt just a way to collect funds and &quot;lose&quot; it, I strongly advise everybody avoid this.<br /><br />I am somewhat experienced with trading and in a bear market without shorting instruments I can assure you that it is almost better to just wait for at least flat price movements. As far as the ability of anybody to consistently predict short term BTC price movements... <br /><br />The only way to guarantee trading gains (ignoring default events) is to maintain a delta neutral portfolio or something that is quite close to that. Then this limits the gains possible to selling option premiums or bid/ask spreads or very short term price deviations and cross market arbitrages.<br /><br />All of these things are possible but takes a fair amount of software to be in place. By the way, I have to admit that I am slightly biased against these type of assets (especially from newbie accts who could well be serial scammers) because I am in the process of completing an OPEN SOURCE Tradebots system where investors simply look at historical performance, trading style and then fund the tradebots they like. In their OWN accounts. So the days of needing to trust the asset issuer, how they trade, etc. will be soon over.<br /><br />While nothing short of a realtime delta neutral portfolio management system to collect spreads and premiums is guaranteed a profit, if you are willing to put some risk capital to fund a specific bot on specific markets, you will be able to see your bot trade with funds you directly control. As long as you choose the right bots, then the money is being made and the chance of scam is not there.<br /><br />So please wait. I am making a total system to allow bot creators to create bots and their past performance is tracked and ranked. And the profits made are shared between the bot creator and the people that fund it. With a small percentage to Tradebots asset for arranging all this.<br /><br />James
