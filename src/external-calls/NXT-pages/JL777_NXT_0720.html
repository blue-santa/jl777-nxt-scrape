					I confirmed that as long as an unconfirmed tx is alive, the assets + NXT it needs are locked, at least I cant submit a new transaction that uses it. so this eliminates double spends pretty effectively and also means that any transaction in the unconfirmed tx list is fully funded. this is a qualitatively stronger commitment for the trade than just having signed tx bytes via offchain, even if all basic tests are passed. <br /><br />This is because a rogue client could send out multiple offchain signed tx all using the same assets. So it needs to be a requirement that all dependent tx to be submitted to the network and appear in the unconfirmed tx list<br /><br />The edge cases are:<br />a) predicted time for a block is wrong and not only that just happens to come right between the expiration times of the different legs. Since all these tx are created within seconds, that means that the unexpectedly long block needs to hit a precise window whose width is a few seconds<br /><br />b) attacker forges a block and only includes the legs of the trade he likes and then empties his acct so the next block wont just confirm the pending tx. Now he cant make a block for 1440 blocks.<br /><br />Due to my previous estimates, b) appears to be a lot of work for making gains via slippage. If you just want to make slippage gains, seems much less work and much more consistent to become a market maker. For a) with jnxt.org predictions of the next 2 blocks having a pretty good success rate, I would be surprised to see any such thing happening very often at all.<br /><br />James

This method eliminates the reliance on the initiator node to actually submit all the trades, though even with makeoffer both sides can just publish all their tx, so this is not really a problem even with a rogue client. Still the one that initiates the trade can decide to not submit with a modified client, so I will need to add a way to detect such misbehaving nodes. After I get InstantDEX into beta test, I will be making the security much, much stronger so this sort of thing and many other bad behavior we will get protection for.<br /><br />With Phasing, we can make the trigger require signoff from both sides (or even three) of the trade. But still one side could withhold the approval vote, so not sure there is any&nbsp; benefit. The much more important benefit is to make all the components of a trade atomic. I am pretty sure Phasing will allow this.<br /><br />James

					I put error checks for outofband pricematches, so they are rejected. Currently I require the matching price to be above the high bid and below the low ask in the NXT AE. I think it would work if it was &gt;= highbid and &lt;= lowask, but it seems cleaner to do it with at least one &quot;pip&quot; separation. This does mean things with 0 decimals and low value will most likely not be tradeable using makeoffer2. just need to wait for Phasing so makeoffer issues can be fixed, then we can get much more resolution in the price than the asset decimals.<br /><br />block 373464 has txid 14565979118655674082, which is the first successful trigger tx for an InstantDEX trade.<br /><br />I did 72NXT for 1 coinoUSD<br /><br />1424647629882861488 is the ask, it is in the unconfirmed trades along with 8698983672084812764 for the fee and 11440344300163450416 is the matching bid.<br /><br />These tx are done for a few minutes now, even though NXT is on a long block. so when the new block comes in they should all get confirmed. yes and they just did!<br /><br />James

If an edge case can occur naturally, it can also be engineered, and will be engineered if there is a financial incentive to do so (which there is or will be), in which case all bets are off in terms of how often this will occur.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/confused-about-supernet-multigateway-instantdex-atomic-bitcoindark-co/msg166955/#msg166955">Quote from: jl777 on March 05, 2015, 08:36:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Also if you are an arbitrageur then unfilled legs are part of the business, if you are not willing to accept a small risk of this, then you shouldnt be arbitraging.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Risk is part of the business, but only in its predictable variety as far as arbitrage is concerned. As an arbitrageur, you'll enter a trade if the gain expectation is high enough after taking into account the gain you stand to make on the arbitrage if it works, the probability that the second leg won't get filled and you have to roll back the first leg, and the cost of rollbacking the first leg by crossing the spread not to mention more complex situation where you would consider delaying the rollback.<br /><br />There is a huge difference in terms of risk between a two-leg trade and a three leg trade, in particular when two legs out of three turn out to be in a low liquidity / large spreads market and it takes up to 1mn to confirm that the first two legs are in. If you allow for edge cases to happen, knowing that they will happen increasingly frequently because there is an incentive to engineer them, you are making the expectation of loss higher for arbitrageurs, and pricing them out for most trades but the juiciest where they would stand to gain more than they risk to lose.<br /><br />You could say farewell, we don't need arbitrageurs, they are only taking liquidity, but that would be ignoring the fact that most market makers are also arbitrageurs, so by making arbitageurs life more difficult you are doing yourself a disservice in the long run.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/confused-about-supernet-multigateway-instantdex-atomic-bitcoindark-co/msg166955/#msg166955">Quote from: jl777 on March 05, 2015, 08:36:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">You are also now stretching the risk by assuming that we will see price movements of 10% in 10 seconds. Exactly how often does this happen?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I haven't given any estimate on the volatility level that would make it a problem for market participants. Arbitageurs for one are making tiny profits on many small transactions. Depending on the profit margin you are looking at for a trade, variations in double or single digit basis points can make the difference between a profit and a loss. This is alright when you already accounted for historical volatility in your trade, but much less ok when you get some extra uncalled for leg coming from nowhere and have to take a 1mn exposure to the market volatility before you can do anything about it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/confused-about-supernet-multigateway-instantdex-atomic-bitcoindark-co/msg166955/#msg166955">Quote from: jl777 on March 05, 2015, 08:36:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you trade forex, is it guaranteed that your trade is filled?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No, but forex is extremely liquid and has tiny spreads so you can easily model the cost of not getting filled, and there are plently of methods to evaluate the probability that you'll be filled. That's a whole different situation than ending up after 1mn with an asset you didn't ask for, and have to roll it to your target asset or close the position in a low liquidity market with large spread.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/confused-about-supernet-multigateway-instantdex-atomic-bitcoindark-co/msg166955/#msg166955">Quote from: jl777 on March 05, 2015, 08:36:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you put in a market order is your price guaranteed?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You don't want to send market orders for you first leg in a low liquidity / wide spread / high volatility market when you are doing arbitrage.

I came here to try to figure if InstantDEX is something I should consider adding to my software stack, and even invest in if it looks really promising. Reasonnably low latency distributed exchanges aren't that many in the crypto-space and there is a strong business case if things are done right. As a NXT developer you have the possibility to make the necessary changes in NXT for it to handle multi-leg transactions atomically just like Ripple is doing. This would once and for all nail all possible corner cases that non-atomic approaches are creating and allow InstantDEX to be really competitive in the field. But that would first require that you acknowledge the limitations of your current approach, assess objectively how they are going to affect future business prospects, and consider working to fix them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>makeoffer has failure modes that expose it to risk and so it will not be supported for GUI invoked usage. Please do not use this API call. There is nothing I can do about the NXT protocol as I am not a NXT core dev. I just write software that uses NXT.<br /><br />So we can limit the discussion to makeoffer2, which is far more robust.<br /><br />If you are thinking that somebody would setup an attack to gain from slippage of unexecuted half of arbitrage, then this is not very practical. What is the economic gain from this? let us say a 1 BTC arbitrage pair, one half isnt filled. The market moves and you cover for a 0.05 BTC loss. Not a great result, but this is the edge case. Now let us calculate the cost to the attacker. We ignore his time to create the attacking software, but he need to forge a block to be able to do this attack. Now if he has 50 million NXT forging for him, he will get ~1 in 10 blocks. So that is about 150 blocks forged for a 1440 block period. After conducting this attack, he will lose the ability to forge for 1440 blocks.<br /><br />Recently the average block is getting around 4 NXT per block * 150 = 600 NXT expected loss. The gain of 0.05 BTC is around 1000 NXT, so there is a gain for 400NXT in this case. But we need to remember the attack is making money due to slippage, so it could just as easily go the other way. Let us assume the attacker is clever enough to complete the trade if it slips against him, but now we have cut the expected return in half to ~500NXT per attack.<br /><br />These are very rought estimates, but I dont think a 1BTC trade size and 5 % slippage are too far from the expected sizes. So that means this is appearing to be a lot of work for a breakeven outcome. Now would I like it if this is not possible to happen under any circumstance? Of course, but I am not a NXT core dev so I cannot do anything about this.<br /><br />Now if we can assume the edge case is &lt; 0.01% of the cases it will have a minimal impact on profitability. I am not quite ready to offer insurance against this scenario, but once we get some actual data, if it is any actual issue then we can make an insurance to cover such slippage losses caused by this edge effect. <br /><br />The edge effect is really more a theoretical possibility as all the transactions are already in the unconfirmedtransactions list. So either they all execute, or they dont. And within seconds of firing off a trade you will know if it was accepted or rejected. Granted you wont be able to retrade what you just obtained until the block is confirmed, but presumably you have an inventory much greater than any single trade, so as long as you arent trading 100% of your inventory this wont really affect you.<br /><br />InstantDEX is a decentralized peer to peer system and I am not a NXT core dev. Given these constraints the makeoffer2 is the best I can do and if this is not good enough, then I can understand that you wont use it. However you seem like a smart enough guy who can factor in the amount of losses from the edge effect that is based on actual statistics and this statistic will be right there on the blockchain as each trigger tx has all the info needed to corrolate all the dependent tx.<br /><br />You say &quot;your architecture and design decisions won't fly and that you are letting large avenues open for things to go horribly wrong&quot; and this seems to me to be assuming that my analysis that the attack vector is about breakeven is incorrect. And also that slippage of one trade per day is a horrible thing. Remember the attacker loses the abiity to attack for 1440 blocks after each attack. I cant believe that this is something so horrible that you cant factor it into your bid/ask spreads. I claim that it wont make financial sense to do these attacks, so we wont see them much at all. But even if there is an active attacker it is happening a few times per week and the downside is slippage.<br /><br />Compared to trading forex where slippage against the house is the norm and where the trade fee is a fixed 3 cents and there is no centralized point of failure, it seems a good tradeoff to me. The technical differences that are necessary will require customizations in your risk assessment module, along with fixed price fees and you can even make a list of accounts that you wont trade against because they attacked you. At least you are in control of all bids and asks and who you are trading with.<br /><br />So we can agree to disagree that setting up the attack makes any financial sense. If you are right that means about 4 trades per week will suffer from slippage. If I am right, more like one trade per TBD and it is a non issue.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. The NXT core devs have Phasing in testing that is able to lock out the edge case, so maybe you should wait until then.

Some participants, for instance arbitrageurs, will be doing transactions with multiple legs. If the first leg is rejected it's fine, no transaction. If the first leg gets filled, they execute the other leg to close the arbitrage. But if the first leg ends up half-executing and yielding a position in an asset that the trader didn't wish to be exposed to, that seriously messes things up.

Does it try to reexecute the second part of the trade with another order? Does it try to roll back the first part of the trade? Does it make the decisions alone (and make the user incure a loss without his consent), does it ask for confirmation, or does it let things as they are?<br /><br />Handling the edge cases will add a lot of logic and create more attack surface. Letting the things as they are and issuing a warning or throwing an exception might be easier but puts the onus of resolving the problem on the user which could be quite daunting for bot developers.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/confused-about-supernet-multigateway-instantdex-atomic-bitcoindark-co/msg166809/#msg166809">Quote from: jl777 on March 05, 2015, 10:53:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">and since it is in the edge case category I think it is fine for even some larger trades<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I really don't think allowing for a vulnerability because it's unlikely is a good idea.

Sorry for the many questions, I'm not very familiar with NXT architecture and since there is no spec for InstanceDEX atm, I'm gropping around <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think you are overestimating the chances of an edge case. I expect that it will happen less than 1 trade in 100,000 maybe much less. Also if you are an arbitrageur then unfilled legs are part of the business, if you are not willing to accept a small risk of this, then you shouldnt be arbitraging. You are also now stretching the risk by assuming that we will see price movements of 10% in 10 seconds. Exactly how often does this happen?<br /><br />If you trade forex, is it guaranteed that your trade is filled? If you put in a market order is your price guaranteed? So you see trading has the risk of market price changes, this is why it is called trading.<br /><br />InstantDEX cannot change the nature of trading, but it does allow people to do realtime trades with each other in a decentralized way where the risk of losing funds outright is not possible and enforced by the blockchain. Maybe there are some other edge cases I missed, but at this point it wont be found without somebody analyzing the source code. That is why it is open source, to get more eyes on the exact logic.<br /><br />I feel that I have answered your questions in plenty of detail and things are now to the point of &quot;arbitrageurs who cant handle partial fills&quot; or &quot;traders who cant handle slippage&quot;. Since these are risks that all markets have and you are still not satisfied I think that we can agree to disagree.<br /><br />makeoffer wont be the method the GUI will use, so the fact it has some edge cases is really not an issue. At the low level API level there are all sorts of things you can do that ends up badly, but if you are making low level API calls this is the ability that is needed.<br /><br />James<br />

I agree that there is no way back once a transaction has been submitted to the <strong>AE</strong> network, and it only takes one of the party broadcasting a signed transaction it received over SuperNet / BTCD / direct connection for the transaction to end up on AE (if it was a valid NXT transaction in first place). So I really need a reply to my earlier question: who is posting the transactions on NXT? Is each node posting his own transactions on NXT (I assumed so far that isn't the case overwise you wouldn't have the no-fee order placement which you call the call-of-fame of InstantDEX)? Or are all the transactions posted all at once at the end once the nodes have agreed to transact together? In the latter case, who is supposed to post the transactions once all has been agreed and signed: the initiating node or the other node? If you can just give some example of the ebb and flow of messages between the nodes, it would really help making sure we are on the same page.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>makeoffer flow is:<br />1) initiator sends info about the trade including reftx hash to the other node<br /><br />2) other node verifies it matches one of its open orders and if it does it sends signed tx that depends on the trigger back to the originating node.<br /><br />3) the originating node verifies what came back matches what it expected and if all is good, it submits the trigger and the other party's tx to the network.<br /><br />makeoffer2 flow is:<br />a) initiator sends info about the trigger tx to the other node and the jump node if it is a hybrid trade, it also submits dependent transactions to the network. <br /><br />b) the other node(s) verify the incoming order is acceptable and they submit their dependent transaction to the network.<br /><br />c) the original node checks to see if all the dependent transactions are in the unconfirmed transactions and that they are what is expected. If so, it submits the trigger, which when confirmed triggers all the other transactions.<br /><br />So the answer is I do it both ways!<br />And the dependent transactions that are sitting in unconfirmed transactions dont incur a fee if they are not executed. So not only is there no fee for submiting bids and asks, unless the transaction is confirmed, there is no fee, even if you start a sequence or are involved in one.<br /><br />The makeoffer sequence is only approved for low value swaps. Its advantage is that it can do trades at fractional prices with much greater resolution than the number of decimals an asset has. It also doesnt require to tie up NXT for dependent transactions. Its problem is that in the edge case, it is possible for makeoffer to end up with one side having received their entire half of the trade without having cost them anything. So, this method would only be safe to do with someone you can trust who will send a balancing tx in these edge cases or for small amounts so that an attack is not worth doing.<br /><br />The makeoffer2 sequence is quite solid and since it is composed of atomic trades of NXT &lt;-&gt; asset regardless of what subset of a trade bundle is not confirmed, there is no financial loss. Yes, the market could move against you on the half of the trade that didnt complete, but it could also move in your favor. Statistically the net effect of this would be zero and since it is in the edge case category I think it is fine for even some larger trades. You do need to have enough NXT to back these trades + 1000 NXT per dependent tx, so from a practical standpoint it might be necessary to break things into smaller pieces<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. Thank you for your insightful questions! I already found and fixed one bug due to them. if you see any holes in the above dont be shy, though it seems not much chance of that

Would work now, but in the close future, when contract are more widespread, what would stop a MMatrix to create a contract that will pay rewards to users who traded with him? When that happens, there will be an incentive for users to change from first-come-first-save and pick best-bribe-first-served instead.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>anybody is free to pay other people for anything. I think you are thinking the fees are huge fees? We are talking about 2.5NXT fee so the bribe cant be more than 2 NXT. Will a 2NXT bribe be enough incentive for people to trade with a rogue node? Probably not until NXT is worth &gt;$1 and in such scenarios there is dancing in the streets for other reasons. Also, BOTH nodes will need to be using the same modified client, so the rogue node has to essentially create a rogue network and if a rogue node can create a larger network with lower spreads and market makers for all the standard pairs, well, then I might start using the rogue network too! However the difficulty in making a modified client, getting large numbers of people to trust a modified client (after all this is akin to an attack and it requires people to run rogue version to save 1NXT? so is the risk that the rogue version is doing some other nasty thing worth the small savings??), and the liklihood that any such rogue market will be smaller than the real one means it will have less liquidity and higher spreads. And that means the rogue network will have worse net prices, even after bribes, so who would bother with all that work?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/confused-about-supernet-multigateway-instantdex-atomic-bitcoindark-co/msg166785/#msg166785">Quote from: jl777 on March 05, 2015, 08:28:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">More practically, if an offer comes in that matches a pending offer you have, it will mark that offer as pending and so only one can be pending at a time per offer you have. After a timeout (10 to 20 seconds) if for whatever reason the trade is not finalized, then it goes back into the available pool. Though I just realized I didnt flip this bit yet! Thanks, thats a bug fixed.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Not sure I understood that well but if you are saying that the user has to approve the trade after he received the MMatrix quote, and has 10 to 20 seconds to decide whether he wants to take the offer or not, that&nbsp; introduces a very dangerous attack against the MMatrix nodes. A user could take advantage of very volatile market conditions, cancel her trade whenever the market moved in the wrong direction, and confirm her trade when the market moved at her advantage.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>there is no cancelling once a signed tx is submitted to the network. the only &quot;attack&quot; possible along these lines is if the user that makes an offer to another node is sitting on a trade for 10 seconds with the ability to abort the trade if it moves against him. Now I dont have tracking of this sort of bad behavior in there yet, but any node that is doing this regularly will gradually find that all the other nodes just reject any tradeoffers it sends. Currently the nodes that initiate are on a 20 second time now and the nodes that receive are on a 10 second timer. Actutally it is a #defined variable as I need to see if this is too much or too little time. if it is 5 seconds and 10 seconds, i dont think there will be many high liquidity markets that move so fast. Also with upcoming Phasing I can make it so neither party has full control over the trigger. Additionally the side that initiates the trade is paying for 2 orderbook fees for hybrid trades, so on average has a bit more cost.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/confused-about-supernet-multigateway-instantdex-atomic-bitcoindark-co/msg166785/#msg166785">Quote from: jl777 on March 05, 2015, 08:28:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">So while technically these transactions are not confirmed until the next block, since all the parties are verifying that everything is properly signed for the proper amounts and it is published to the blockchain, it is just a matter of time for them to be confirmed. It is like after you click on Send Money and it hits the blockchain, the money it is spent. Some extreme edge cases make it possible for some of the dependent transactions to not get confirmed</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Can you give an example of edge case?<br />What would be the transactions posted to AE for a trade? the buy and sell order and 2x fee payment to InstantDEX?<br />What prevents the sender from dropping InstantDEX fee payment transactions since AE has no way to enforce something it's not even aware of? Could'n the sender even abuse the MMatrix by propagating only the fee payment so that the MMatrix ends up paying a fee for a transaction that wasn't even completed?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>All edge cases have the effect of eliminating one or more transaction from being completed. One way is due to small timing differences in the pending tx. The deadline is specified in minutes from the transaction timestamp and this timestamp could be off by a second or even 3 among the set of linked transactions. Now if the trigger transaction is delayed to the last moment, then it is followed by a long block that is exactly in the middle of the expiration times of the pending tx, then some of the pending tx will expire while others get confirmed. With TF we can predict the likely time a block will get confirmed and the trigger deadline is set to expire one block before the dependent tx. So when I change from an arbitrary 10 minutes for trigger and 20 minutes for dependent tx, then the edge case is only when the predicted account doesnt generate the block and the block ends up in the middle of the different expiration times. Since all the component tx are created offchain as fast as the packets directly get to the other nodes, in most cases the timestamp will be very close together.<br /><br />So this is why I call them edge cases and even in these worst cases, we end up with a marketrate swap and an unfilled AE order. Not great, inconvenient, but not any disaster.<br /><br />Remember the trigger transaction? The fee payment is the trigger so barring a rogue network at least one fee is coming in. Also the originating node is verifying the other node has made a payment. I also think you should stop thinking about MMatrix nodes having super special roles as I have made it so they are not even necessary and why would a MMatrix node agree to pay a txfee for a trade set that it is not involved in? The hybrid orderbook market maker is not charged an InstantDEX fee, just a 1NXT fee for NXT tx. And any node can be a liquidity provider for the hybrid books.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/confused-about-supernet-multigateway-instantdex-atomic-bitcoindark-co/msg166785/#msg166785">Quote from: jl777 on March 05, 2015, 08:28:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I choose a clearing price at the median of high bid and low ask on the orderbook and since both sides are adding equal liquidity on both sides, even if there are other orders, it all just clears. Of course if at the very block somebody is submitting an order at the exact same price then it could end up leaving one half of the trade partially filled.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Who chooses the clearing price? The MMatrix? The user? A consensus between the two?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>both nodes use the same algorithm to calculate the trades required and they both select the median of highbid and lowask. Again, MMatrix is not taking any controlling role in this, it is just a node that is more likely to be on the other side of trades as it is actively seeking orders out, but it acts just as if it is another normal node, because it is. The only preference is that it could be getting some direct quotes slightly ahead of the rest of the network<br /><br />James
