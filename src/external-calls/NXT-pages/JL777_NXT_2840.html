Also I am proposing a percentage from ALL of bter trade commissions, not just NXT. The are doing ~10000 BTC per week so that is 20 BTC per week if 50% goes to the repurchase. Estimated 3 year payback, but a lot of people will take the bid at a discount, so I am estimating closer to one year payback at these rates.<br /><br />The alternative for bter is the loss of ~90% of their business. That is just a guess, but my intuition returns such a number when I think about the scenario of bter not coming up with a believable plan for makegood.<br /><br />James

I had about 1% of my Nxt worth on Bter, which isn't much compared to many others. I would be willing to buy the stolenNXT equal to 2% of my Nxt worth. In fact, I'll send it now if someone wants to provide escrow. The commitment conditions include having an asset that is acceptable to James. He said he would write it up, so that should not be a problem. I would also like some commitments from Bter that they will clean up their act - put new security measures in place, and be audited by security experts, for example. This is something they would have to do, anyway, to regain the trust of potential investors. <br /><br />Does Option 4 punish the thief or recover the NXT? No. But I don't think Option 3 is the way to go. Like QBTC and crimi, I am very suspicious of a plan so heavily promoted by the very exchange that was harmed. I do not want to set a precedent of letting centralized exchanges have so much influence over what Nxt does with it's blockchain. <br /><br />If this escrow thing and getting Option 4 off the ground is something that catches fire, we can iron out the details as we go. I just wanted to make a pledge of some funds to begin making Option 4 a reality. If you also support Option 4, speak up here and pledge something, a percentage or amount, so we can see where we are.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>As soon as there is enough support for option 4, I will issue the stolenNXT asset and I am assuming bter will be able to get me a list of accounts/amounts. If not, I am not sure how to properly distribute the stolenNXT<br /><br />Once the stolenNXT is issued and distributed, then the free market decides when people want to collect on whatever bid there is. <br /><br />I can keepsafe any funds raised, but really just need to put bids in AE no need to send any funds anywhere. As soon as I get the distribution list, the stolenNXT gets dividended out and the long road to clearing out the stolenNXT can begin. As soon as bter has purchased all the stolenNXT, this asset will cease to exist, I suggest that bter would send to genesis any stolenNXT they purchase back<br /><br />James

					uMGW peoples I need your help<br />I made surgical changes to the code in such a way that I think (hope) it will work post-DGS block. However, I am not very well setup to actually test this on testnet. Since testnet is already post-DGS block if the latest changes works on testnet, that is good indication it will work on mainnet.<br /><br />Any chance you can get it verified, using any coin that previously worked?<br />I am most concerned that either the AM's will just not be seen and so people wont get deposit addresses or see that their deposit was received, or that withdraw's wont be properly recognized and withdraws wont work.<br /><br />Basically MGW could be totally broken, or work 100% or anything in between.<br /><br />James

What you are proposing is killing Nxt's future and it won't get us anywhere near the place you want it to be. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That is well debatable. The community is fully divided on that. Saying such as being a sure thing is foolish.<br /><br />In my opinion the solution to block hacker's account only through a hard fork is a sign of exceptional communal resolve. It's not a rollback. It is a collaborative action that mitigates damage done by a malevolent party. The effect to NXT users is only beneficial. The effect to outside observers is mixed and not prominent. Do not let fear take you over and prevent you from taking action when it needs to be taken.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">50m Nxt flooding the markets are very unlikely.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Not flooding but exerting incredible downward pressure during the next 3, 6 or even 12 months. It is nearly certain. The hacker will of course sell it to a private dark side investor who mixes it, cashes out some, and sells the rest forward to the next investor for a fraction of the market price. Rinse and repeat until done.<br /><br />1.5 million USD extra injection to the buy side would not suffice to keep NXT afloat, because of the bad rep causing more sell pressure.<br /><br />By blocking the 50M from being sold, we just have to deal with the bad rep and not the massive selling million after million until exhaustion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So where is the line when you say: we freeze that account?<br /><br />Is it when 20 million gets stolen? 10 million? 100 thousand? Who needs to cry wolf to get people to freeze &quot;account X&quot;?<br />Do we need everyone to be affected by the theft? 1000 people? 100 people? 10?<br /><br />It's a VERY slippery slope Graviton... Very. (besides you wanting to use CUSTOMER deposits, which aren't yours!)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I dont remember any exchange and certainly not DGEX, ever saying they wont forge. It is common for banks to earn interest on customer deposits? I think they do a lot more than just earn interest (fractional reserve lending!), so on this issue regardless of the politics, the &quot;possession in 90% of the law&quot; seems to apply.<br /><br />Whoever has access to the funds gets to decide what to do with it, eg. forge or not, which version or not.<br /><br />Of course, if DGEX wants to reflect the will of his customers, he could setup a vote, weighed by the amount in their accounts and forge proportionally to each block. That is the math based way to defuse the politics around this<br /><br />James

					The fourth solution:<br /><br />Issue 51.x million stolenNXT assets and distribute them proportionally to the people who had the deposits in bter. This idea I copied from Lee.<br /><br />Now, if any negotiations/bounty hunting/etc. gets all the NXT back, it is simple, put a bid on NXT AE at 1 NXT per 1 stolenNXT. 5 million NXT has already been recovered, so the initial bid should be ~0.1 NXT per stolenNXT. Those that are happy to recoup anything are then free to accept this bid, they get a guaranteed 10% back, the others will get a higher chance for full recovery.<br /><br />Since full recovery from hacker is no 100% certain event, it is bter's responsibility to makegood the difference. This is what Tristan at Poloniex did, though 100 BTC vs 50 million NXT is so much different we cant compare the two, still bter used to be a significant exchange and if it can come up with a plan to make everybody whole, it will survive this. If not, I estimate chances of bter to become an irrelevant small exchange to be 90%+<br /><br />sorry, freeworm, this is the reality. If bter does not have a plan that will make its depositors whole, you will lose 90%+ of all your other trading volumes and I doubt you will survive. <br /><br />So, it is in bter's interest to make sure all NXT holders are repaid. I understand <del>50</del> 45 million NXT is enormous amount, but if you can assure people that in spite of this impossible situation you have a plan with very good chance of success, then bter will become very well respected and will be able to not only survive but even become more popular.<br /><br />This is what needs to be done. Allocate HALF your revenues to repurchase the stolenNXT. Each week, increase the bid for the stolenNXT by half your revenues added to the repurchase amount. So if you are doing 10000 BTC of trading in a week, at 0.2% commission on each side, 20 BTC is added to the bid of the stolenNXT. this will not be much of a change for one week, but over time, especially if your volumes grow as this becomes a way for the general crypto community to help out just by using bter for their trading, cuz they can trust bter to makegood. If your trading volumes double, then you actually are making the same revenues. Much better than 90% reductions.<br /><br />let us work the numbers.<br /><br />20 BTC @ 15000 NXT/BTC is 300,000 NXT per week, this is 150 weeks or three years. A long, long time, but this is much better than never.<br /><br />Also, I expect that as the bid for the stolenNXT keeps increasing, more and more people will be selling and every sale below 1:1 is reducing this debt, so I estimate that if you can be adding 300K NXT per week, it will actually clear out the debt in closer to a year's time. If you get massive positive PR and a sympathy trading business, then maybe it could be much faster.<br /><br />I hope that freeworm will be realistic and open to this plan. I will help how I can for the structuring of this<br /><br />James<br />

At worst it will temporarily allow people like me to buy NXT at halfprice.

So there is no consensus on the trade until two nodes agree with each other and publish it on the blockchain.<br /><br />At first people said MGW was too good to be true and not possible.<br /><br />While tradebots started as something that is unique to each node, I realized that with some data synchronization functions, any group of people (corporation) can deploy a set of linked tradebots and they would be able to maintain a custom blockchain, I believe this is also called parallel chains, but not sure of all the terminology. I intend to make it so that it wont be too hard to create new blockchains that only people running that tradebot. Not sure of what all this enables, but since it is Turing complete and I will give it full power to all available APIs (NXT, bitcoin, any website, crypto, filesystem, networking, etc.) I expect that basically anything anybody wants to do will be able to be done and they can publish their tradebot in a Tradebot Store.<br /><br />Then the popular tradebots end up making a parallel blockchain for whatever that tradebot does and only the people who have installed it incur the costs from running it. Is this better than etherium? I cant claim that, it is just a totally different thing it is doing. there is no way I can compete with buterin and a zillion dollars. I am just a simple C programmer<br /><br />James
