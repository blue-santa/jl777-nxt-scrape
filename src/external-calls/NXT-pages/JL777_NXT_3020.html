					Current solutions<br />There are a number of cryptocurrencies that offer privacy features by mitigating against such attacks in different ways, with varying degrees of success. None is entirely satisfactory – either because the level of anonymity gained is limited, in theory or in practice, and/or because the solutions raise other issues with regards to the long-term viability of the cryptocurrency.<br />While no technical solution can solve all aspects of the problem, especially against a determined attacker with almost unlimited resources, there are methods than can be used to protect the privacy of cryptocurrency users.<br />It seems counterintuitive that it could be possible both to enjoy the benefits of a publicly and permanently available blockchain, and to maintain the privacy of its users. However, this does indeed become possible to a significant degree with the use of certain processes and advanced mathematical techniques.<br />Mixing<br />A hoard of 143 gold coins is liberated from a chest belonging to Captain Crunch. Should the thief be intercepted with the gold in his possession, his crime will be known. To disguise the theft, the culprit deposits sets of 1, 10 and 100 coins with a series of trusted pirate acquaintances, to be recovered at a later time in a series of arbitrary amounts. Since the stolen coins are mixed with other coins in the chests, it is very difficult to prove which coins really belong to Captain Crunch – even if they could be traced to these locations. As an aside, it is worth remembering that there is limited honour among pirates, so the thief may find he has been double-crossed when he tries to reclaim his loot.<br />[Image similar to:&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;<a href="https://www.darkcoin.io/downloads/DarkcoinWhitepaper.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.darkcoin.io/downloads/DarkcoinWhitepaper.pdf</a>&quot;<a href="https://www.darkcoin.io/downloads/DarkcoinWhitepaper.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.darkcoin.io/downloads/DarkcoinWhitepaper.pdf</a> p. 3]<br />Mixing services combine coins from many different sources before sending them back to their original owners (usually for a fee), with the intention of obscuring where the funds originated. In their simplest form, mixers are operated by individuals and users are simply required to trust them to return their funds. This is particularly unsatisfactory since they are often operated anonymously.<br />More sophisticated forms of mixing have been automated and incorporated into the protocols of different cryptocurrencies. For example, Darkcoin uses an implementation of CoinJoin called DarkSend. This optional facility collects together inputs of the same size (denominations in powers of 10 are used – 1 DRK, 10 DRK, 100 DRK and so on) into a DarkSend Pool. Coins are mixed within the DarkSend Pool and are returned to their owners in a series of different amounts. The DarkSend Pool is operated by a master node elected from its participants.<br />Ring signatures<br />Most treasure chests can only be opened with a single key, carefully guarded by the owner. However, it is known that a particular treasure chest can be opened by several people: using the key owned by the Flying Dutchman; a skeleton key belonging to Hector Barbossa; the ancient tool possessed by Guybrush Threepwood; or the toothpick belonging to the Dread Pirate Roberts. When the treasure chest is opened, there is no way of telling which of these four keys has been used.<br /><br />Image: ring signature representation<br /><br />A second approach to obscuring the identity of the sender is to sign the transaction using one of a number of possible keys. This is made possible by the development of ring signatures, of which CryptoNote (also employed by Monero and several other cryptocurrencies) is the best-known implementation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Ring signature is a more sophisticated scheme, which in fact may demand several different public keys for verification. In the case of ring signature, we have a group of individuals, each with their own secret and public key. The statement proved by ring signatures is that the signer of a given message is a member of the group. The main distinction with the ordinary digital signature schemes is that the signer needs a single secret key, but a verifier cannot establish the exact identity of the signer. Therefore, if you encounter a ring signature with the public keys of Alice, Bob and Carol, you can only claim that one of these individuals was the signer but you will not be able to pinpoint him or her. <br /><br />Drawbacks and vulnerabilities<br />As stated above, none of the existing solutions are truly satisfactory, though for different reasons. Coin mixing solutions are effective in some circumstances but are relatively trivial to deanonymise at the level discussed in this paper, where privacy centres around transactions between single users. Increases in computer power may render past mixing routinely transparent in the future. To compound matters, large quantities of coins are hard to anonymise quickly, unless there are similarly large sums with which to mix them.<br />Ring signatures are substantially more powerful, since each transaction provides only statistical correlations. Assuming each transaction has 10 possible parties involved, with any length of chaining the power of statistical linkage quickly reduces to the level of background noise. Coins based on CryptoNote may (like DarkSend) also minimise the problem of a Mantissa attack by splitting all of the transactions into power-of-10 outputs (for example, 1.23 RingCoins would be treated as 1 RC + 0.2 RC + 0.03 RC). Thus a transaction is obscured, though some weak correlations are still possible. <br />Centralisation and money flow<br />The centralisation inherent in most mixing services represents a clear vulnerability. Where trust in an individual is required, this constitutes an unacceptable solution for most users. Additionally,<br />‘[DarkSend] Masternodes can be controlled and thus the controller of the Masternode can learn about a certain transaction, if they were inclined to. There is a negative incentive to own many masternodes through their high price (so if a government agency wanted to own all masternodes that would escalate the cost of owning the nodes to a very high price) but this in itself does not prevent the mapping of the network to a certain degree. The next versions of DarkSend aim to improve on this aspect in particular.’<br />Mixing using protocols such as CoinJoin ‘obfuscates money flows, and not account balances’, meaning that information on and off the blockchain can still be analysed to build up a picture of accounts usage and owner identity. <br />Blockchain bloat<br />Ring signatures typically offer a superior degree of privacy over mixing solutions. Unfortunately, one of the major issues with cryptocurrencies that derive their privacy from ring signatures is blockchain bloat. Bitcoin blocks may contain several hundred transactions within a package of 200-400 Kb. Monero block sizes regularly exceed 10Kb and often 20Kb but contain just a handful of transactions. At the beginning of August 2014, Bitcoin’s blockchain was around 20 Gb. (Most of the increase occurred in the last two years, which account for over 90 percent of Bitcoin’s 43 million total transactions and 313,000 blocks at that time.) By contrast, Monero’s blockchain stood at around 2 Gb after just three months and 170,000 transactions: an order-of-magnitude difference. These and other issues were noted by one reviewer:<br />‘There are some critical problems with CryptoNote. The size of the the entire project is just enormous. Key sizes are double the usual size. Unspent transaction output sets and key image sets both grow in an uncontrolled way. Most troubling is the centralization point of allowing an anonymous person on the internet choosing all of our elliptic curve constants without explaining himself.’<br />It is rightly acknowledged that ‘CryptoNote is absolutely spectacular’ and the advances it offers groundbreaking. Nevertheless, unless addressed, the blockchain bloat associated with the use of ring signatures is likely to limit widespread adoption of the cryptocurrencies based on them.<br /><br /><br />

					Teleport: anonymity through off-blockchain transaction information transfer<br />A Dark Paper for BTCD<br /><br />Captain James Lee<br />Contact: PM jl777 on NXTforum.org<br />August, 2014<br /><br />Summary<br />Alice acquires a treasure map drawn by pirate Jack Sparrow. Understanding that some pirates may be untrustworthy, Alice digs up the treasure and moves it to a different chest in another location. She copies the map and updates it with a new ‘X marks the spot’, crossing out the previous one and discarding the old map. Alice loses her new map to Bob in a game of chance. Bob, suspecting that Alice may have kept a copy of the map, moves the treasure, makes a copy of the map himself and updates it with a new ‘X’, again discarding the original. He later uses the new map as payment for Catherine. In such fashion, the map and the location of the treasure change hands many times over. However, if care is taken when passing each map on, then there is no evidence for the identity of any of the previous owners. The only thing we know for sure is that the treasure and the first map once belonged to Jack Sparrow. <br />Teleport uses packages called telepods to send all the information required to make a transaction to the desired recipient, over a secure connection outside of the blockchain. Telepods are cloned by the recipient to prevent double spending, and sent to the next recipient when desired – or else emptied onto a previously-used account on the blockchain again. The contents of the telepod are therefore recorded on the blockchain at the point of cloning. However, if a completely new address is used every time, there is no way to know who has held the telepod over the course of its lifespan. The only thing that may conceivably be inferred is the original creator of the telepod.<br /><br /><br />Part I<br />Current approaches and limitations to privacy<br />Introduction<br />Bitcoin has been a hugely successful implementation of peer-to-peer cash. The use of proof-of-work and blockchain technology allows users to establish consensus and prove ownership with no centralised authority, enabling fast, secure and almost free transfer of money over the internet for the first time.<br />However, the transparency with which this system necessarily operates is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it prevents fraud: everyone on the network can see the contents of any address and whether a new transaction is consistent with the existing blockchain, the shared ledger of previous transactions. But this transparency also means that privacy is almost impossible. <br />There are several ways in which privacy may be compromised. Three of the chief means in which blockchain analysis can be used include:<br />1) Transaction linkage<br />Although each map bears only one current location for the treasure, ‘X’, evidence for every previous location is preserved. The discarded maps show incrementally more disused marks, so that by studying previous maps a perfect history can be constructed of where the treasure has been buried for each successive owner. In itself, this may pose no problem, especially if there is no other information to identify the owner. However, as soon as additional details are included on the map – such as locations for other hoards of treasure, frequented taverns, and so on – then deductions may start to be made about who they are.<br />Although Bitcoin payments are often described as anonymous, they are really pseudonymous: the identity of the owner of a given address may not be known, but there is a permanent record of every transaction into and out of every account. Nakamoto’s original paper acknowledges this:<br />‘The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method... The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.’<br />[Image: tx linkage]<br />Every bitcoin transaction is traceable back to the block from which it was mined, as well as to every other address with which transactions have occurred. Moreover, this information may be linked to individuals through various means, as described below.<br />2) Fingerprinting<br />Intending to transition from a life upon the high seas to one as an honourable businessman, Bootstrap Bill makes it known that he wants to use his savings of 197 gold coins to purchase a large amount of jute. The East India Trading Company recognises this move as a threat to their monopoly on the jute trade. Although the sale goes ahead in secret, the Company knows the going price for jute, 4.63 gold coins per metric bushel. They therefore know that Bill has probably purchased in the region of 43 metric bushels of jute. Spies are instructed to look through merchants’ accounts for the previous week for such an amount, in the hope of tracking Bill and stopping him from selling his goods.<br />Every transaction is time-stamped, and the entire blockchain can be viewed by anyone. If Alice is known to have made a transaction to Bob around a certain time, and there is only one transaction recorded during the relevant period, then clearly the sending address belongs to Alice and the recipient’s address belongs to Bob. Even if a large number of transactions occur in that interval, it may be possible to build up a picture over time based on statistical probabilities. This approach, called Transaction Fingerprinting, has successfully been used to identify owners of specific addresses: <br />‘First, we developed a system for scraping bitcoin addresses from public forums. Second, we include a mechanism for matching users to transactions using incomplete transaction information. For example, suppose we hear Bob say to Alice: “I sent you $100 in bitcoins yesterday at noon”; though we don’t know the exact time of the transaction (since “at noon” could easily mean 11:50 or 12:10) or the exact amount in bitcoins (exchange rates fluctuate significantly), we can generate candidate transaction matches and associated matching probabilities.’<br />3) Mantissa attack<br />Realising that the East India Trading Company know of his plan and will be monitoring the seas to eliminate the competition, Bootstrap Bill decides to sell the jute in three different locations. Meanwhile, the Company’s spies have discovered Bill’s purchase in the ledgers of a wealthy merchant, learning that he bought 41.94 metric bushels of jute. Bill sells his jute in batches of 20, 15 and 6.94 metric bushels. Round number consignments are frequently traded and prompt no questions. Unfortunately, the spies are alerted by the distinctive amount after the decimal point for the last sale, so the Company is able to determine where he sold it and therefore his most recent location.<br />Any amount of money can be sent with Bitcoin, and since the exchange value is floating and dollar-equivalent sums are often transacted, these amounts may not be round numbers – leading to a very specific mantissa or significand (the numbers after the decimal point). If an unusual amount is noticed – either because of its large size, or because it appears to be an otherwise arbitrary number – then a link may be made, since the odds of this being a coincidence are minimal. If Alice sends Bob 3.14159265 bitcoins then the blockchain can easily be scanned and any accounts transacting that amount tagged. Even if there are several addresses sending the relevant amount, some statistical correlations can be made.<br />‘Order books for Bitcoin exchanges are typically available to support trading tools. As orders are often placed in Bitcoin values converted from other currencies, they have a precise decimal value with eight significant digits. It may be possible to find transactions with corresponding amounts and thus map public-keys and transactions to the exchanges.’<br />Using a combination of these approaches, it is entirely possible to track payments through the blockchain and trace them to individuals. This ultimately makes Bitcoin ‘more traceable than cash... you have to go to great lengths to cover your tracks.’<br />

					<br />As it is, crypto is presented as a replacement for cash, but it is cash that can be used to show your every transaction! The govt&#039;s are deanonymizing the BTC blockchain and making database of BTC address to social security number. As USA gets more and more desperate for funds (they are already technically insolvent), the natural thing is to start confiscating. Of course, they will make laws that are impossible to actually follow (easy to do, make law A and also law B that contradicts A, you either violate A or B) and then use that to leverage you into paying a &quot;fine&quot;<br /><br />This loss of cash is the greatest threat faced by humanity, well, ever. Once all finances are able to be monitored, then all freedoms are totally at the discretion of the powers that be. It is horrifying to me that crypto that has the power to free the people is being used in a plan to enslave them!<br /><br />It turns out crypto all along had the ability to be used as cash. I just was lucky enough to discover this treasure:<br /><br /><a href="http://209.126.70.170/DarkPaper.doc" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.70.170/DarkPaper.doc</a> <br /><br />There it is, there are no pretty pics yet, but this recent speculative runup is making BTCD some sort of tool for short sighted pump and dumpers and I dont want that for BTCD. Also, based on recent price action, my guess is that the people who have seen the DarkPaper are having some unfair advantage, so I want to level the playing field. I did just get the finalized text from Cassius the other day, but things happen so fast! I was waiting for the graphic illustrations, but when BTCD is #3 in volume I want everybody to have the same info to make their decisions.<br /><br />James

In some short hours it has gained another big percentage.<br />I put the bid at 15000 NXT for sharkfund0, that is 50% gain. Where is Johnson now?<br /><br />expect volatility ahead, bid could easily drop back to 13000 or 12000<br />This is what I warned about, also I am busy coding so I cant keep updating in semi realtime like shortNXT does. Please do not complain if my updates lag the market and please do not complain of big roller coaster.<br /><br />I have warned. I wont always have time to post details, but I will try to update the sharkfund0 bid, so just check AE for latest bid.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I believe sharkfund0 is the largest BTCD hodler, I got way more than the usual target of 1%<br />

I did this in a second, but you get the idea.<br /><br /><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/2lau88h.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes, like the &quot;Intel inside&quot; campaign. Some recognizable &quot;sticker&quot; that can be put on reskinned GUI. Casual end users might not even notice that it is powered by NXT, but the key influencers will sure notice. I want to have existing coins make a reskinned GUI, so their users are happy to get 2.0 functions. I have a way to automatically link NXT address to each of the other coin's address, so they can actually login using their public coin address.<br /><br />So a reskinned DOGE web GUI would of course have cute doggies (and NXT inside sticker) and there will be a button in their QT wallet that just opens up a browser to 127.0.0.1:7876, automatically logged into their NXT account derived from their coin address. Just need to figure a way to get them a few NXT from faucet so they can start right away using all the 2.0 crypto features.<br /><br />Note, this campaign will get NXT into thousands of new users who otherwise would NEVER even bother to check it out. Since NXT will get all the txfees from the 2.0 tx, we should be happy NXT provides the power to do so. Another thing is that since NXT will need to be installed alongside the other coin, we will also get thousands of additional nodes.<br /><br />With the revenue sharing that is available to people running server class nodes, this should add hundreds of decent caliber servers to the NXT network and not needing of any large subsidy as they will do this to get revenue sharing<br /><br />James

If I can pick the assets that will do the best and reinvest in those, that will continue creating increased dividends.<br /><br />So, if I cant find any promising assets, then it would make sense to repurchase JLH.

					This might be a bit offtopic, I apologize if it is, but this thread has the attention of the right people.<br /><br />I have added C interpreter to run in NXTservices. Now clearly it is Turing complete as it is almost full C language (picoc), but of course each node is running a separate set of scripts (tradebots), so clearly it is not decentralized.<br /><br />My question is what happens if I enforce identical tradebots to be on all participating nodes. Now we are not requiring a synchronized blockchain, but rather a synchronized set of tradebots. I think this is something in between a decentralized system and just a network of independent nodes. Not sure if there is a technical name for this, but that is not so important, just curious about that.<br /><br />OK, now we take the big step. All of the synchronized tradebots now synchronize data by communicating with each other. At this point, we have identical code and identical data on all the participating nodes. As near as I can tell, this is a decentralized system.<br /><br />So, if I am correct, then does that mean it is possible to create an offblockchain blockchain? Is this a sidechain, parallel chain?<br /><br />Regardless of what it is, I think it could be a useful testbed for trying out new things. <br /><br />James

That would ease none of the centralization concerns. MGW is centralized and there's no point pretending it's not. <br /><br />The centralization concerns need to be improved by improving the technology. It needs multisig integration, and realtime monitoring. (Not saying that deployment should be stalled for this, but these features should be added later on.)<br /><br />As for the production servers, it seems that they should have been in place weeks ago. Maybe the MGW needs a more active leader driving the deployment. (Not meant as a criticism of James, just he has enough on his plate.) I propose VanBreuk.<br /><br />Edit: These last 3 posts are in the wrong thread. They shouldn't be in a thread where users come to look for MGW support. Maybe a mod could move them?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am first to admit I have been a horrible MGW manager for its production deployment. This is because I am NOT doing this. Think of me as just the dev for the tech. Assume that I will not do anything active regarding the production deployment.<br />Yes, good idea to choose a leader!<br />Start a nomination process, if more than one person wants the responsibility, have a vote. You know the usual chaos<br /><br />If you all count on me to get the MGW to production, you will wait till next year!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. There are so many threads, I have no idea where what is supposed to go. I liked the linear monster thread, anyway move these wherever they need to be. Get an MGW leader ASAP. good plan

My last withdrawal showed up in about 10 minutes, the deposit I've just done was there in like 4 minutes.<br /><br />I think this cow is capable of flying. ;-)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes! I am really glad for your help in tracking down the issues with VIA. I believe a lot of other coins had the same issues. I think you can see now that to add a new coin really should be a matter of hours, mostly in waiting for the coin daemons to download their blockchain <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James
