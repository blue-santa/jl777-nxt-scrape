When you are selling things you don't want others to know about your turnover nor who your customers are (with NXT they could even be contacted). With the blockchain explorer everyone out there can see your transactions.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My NXTmixer is based on the idea of a shadow account. Actually two, one for receiving and one for sending. These account numbers are only sent under encryption to the NXTmixer so nobody else will even know you have these accounts.<br /><br />Now, all spending instructions from NXT accounts are sent under encryption, but everyone is always sending at the same time, so there is no timing analysis possible. People would tell the NXTmixer to send to your normal NXT account, but the NXTmixer reroutes it to your shadow account. You can change the shadow accts at anytime, so if you are receiving payments to shadowA, you now have funds that your can spend from shadowA and while blockchain analysis can find that payments came in and out of shadowA, it could be anybody's acct.<br /><br />The problem is the initial funding of the shadow account. Unless there are strict restrictions on how much and when, knapsack analysis will be able to correlate funding of shadow accounts. This is where NXTcash comes in. The power of NXTcash (zerocoin) is that it can essentially teleport funds from one account to another (assuming you take proper precautions). However, the need to use a different IPaddress and preferably geolocation makes maintaining anonymity with zerocash type of solutions, not so user friendly.<br /><br />My thinking is to use the NXTcash mechanism to fund the NXTmixer accounts. There is also the possibility of using AT to provide a funding mechanism. All of this needs to be wrapped into a user friendly interface that makes it push button easy and to enforce best use practices. Realistically, we are looking at summertime before there is any chance of getting all of this into place. I also have not figured out how exactly to deploy this, but it is actively percolating as I work on the other projects, which frequently end up creating nice modules for the anonymity stuff to utilize<br /><br />James

					For most of my projects, I kept wanting to be able to just map an in-memory data structure from another NXT node (with its permission!) to a local buffer. Without having to deal with sockets, TCP, UDP, etc. Well, I searched but couldnt find anything that quite fit the bill<br /><br />I also ran into the problem of non-servers just not accepting connections, so peer to peer comms becomes problematic as one side has to accept the connection from the other. TCP is a lot more problematic than UDP, but UDP is unreliable. NATS, big complicated network stuff. Luckily I discovered the right search term for this problem &quot;hole punching&quot; and soon found a decent C library that did the basics.<br /><br />This whole UDP hole punching is pretty tricky, but I think I finally have it pretty stable. It now has a chat system, encryption of most comms and strategic use of NXT token authentication to prevent spoofing. The encryption is using a different Curve25519 and a new public/private key is generate each time you start the program. less data for the bad guys to correlate.<br /><br />Then there is the issue that UDP is unreliable and I can confirm that it is! OK, no surprise there, so round two added crc32 to each fragment and in the process of feeding back the crc that the receiving side got to the sending side. Not so easy though, because neither side can be sure what state the other side is in, so maybe send back the crc to let the receiver know that the sender got the crc that the receiver got. Who's on first??<br /><br />I've spent so much time on this as the ability to easily synchronize data between arbitrary peers is pretty fundamental. Add in the fact that it is encrypted and happens in realtime and I thought it merited its own thread.<br /><br />It will used by multigateway for withdrawal synchronizing, NXTsubatomic/NXTatomic for trade negotiation, NXTorrent for buyer/seller encrypted chat, etc.<br /><br />Ive already got the flow control done and should be able to finish the reliable UDP layer tonight and hopefully then the synchronization will go quickly.<br /><br />If all goes to plan, tomorrow I can port NXTsubatomic/NXTatomic to directly use NXTsync and maybe even code up the API. Then a NXTorrent update and back to multigateway. I need to finish that in time for NXT AE going mainnet!<br /><br />James

Here's his answer:<br />&quot;We had nodes in different datacenters. All these nodes were connected to Nxt network (to different peers!) and had direct connections to each other. Once a node received a block or an unconfirmed transaction it sent this to other nodes (not Nxt peers). The others measured time between the signal and time when they received the same block/transaction from Nxt peers. The delay is the main indicator that shows time of network convergence. During DDoS attacks average convergence time becomes much higher. Forks r also easily detected.<br />We also measure load on other peers by sending transactions to one of them from one node and receiving on another one. U can easily extended this approach and add extra functionality.&quot;<br />******<br /><br />This is the basic approach I will use. I dont see why it cant be decentralized by each node direct connecting to random (or strategically selected) peers and then each subset cross reporting to the other subsets. There wont be any centralized point, the NXThealth monitoring would essentially be a parallel network.<br /><br />Since all the code will be distributed across many nodes, an attacker would have to successfully attack the NXThealth network at the same time as the actual NXT network to pull anything off. If you are still paranoid, you can write a network correlator to make sure the NXThealth network is reporting the same data as the NXT network itself<br /><br />I am currently testing NXTsync that allows any NXT node to directly sync memory (or files) with any other node. By default all comms are encrypted with a session specific key, additionally NXT token authorization can also be used.<br /><br />Once this works, I think I just need to have each node update the sharedmemory with the raw data and update summary data, which then propagates to the other nodes. Just need to figure out what data each node needs to maintain. Probably just start with time of most recent block and its hash. Each node will end up with a slightly different view of the network. Once the NXThealth nodes are maintaining this data, each node can query a random sampling of the entire population of NXThealth nodes and as long as there isnt a big change with one subset vs the other subsets, it seems pretty safe to assume that is the real state<br /><br />James<br />

Everything is encrypted with session based keys and all file transfers require NXT token authorization. This prevents spoofing via man in the middle attacks.<br /><br />I also got it so that the directory server can disappear and peer to peer comms continue. Of course making new peerto peer connections wont be possible until the server comes back, but I almost got a decentralized directory server to work, but it just wasnt cooperating and it was taking too long.<br /><br />So, next version will be v10, but could be another day or two.<br /><br />James

					I guess I should announce that NXTcoinsco will also be listed just by the fact that I will issue 1 million shares then day NXT AE goes mainnet.<br /><br />As you probably know, I will be making some coins on top of NXT. I might even make some using parallel chains or monetary system when they are available. For now, the only announced coin is nodecoin. There is another secret coin that I will also be doing. Instead of premining or instamining, etc. I will make my coins send 10% of mining output to NXTcoinsco, to be allocated among NXTcoinsco holders. This will include all the jl777 coins and coins other people make using the NXTcoinsco development kit.<br /><br />This project is a bit longer term as I need to finish the current batch of projects before I can actually properly implement this. Within a day, 15%+ has been spoken for.

The reason you do not have a clue is because you do not investigate. If you do, you would use link in my signature and find out my<br />NXT address and then check my NXT balance (and also realise no one donated anything at all so far, kickass community obviously). Since evidently even that little work is<br />too much for you it would be great if you start investigating and thinking for yourself else you might easily find yourself holding the bags for too long. 2M USD too low? NXT<br />can go down to 0 USD anytime, it is far from being tested enough. The fact NXT is not based on countless times proven Bitcoin code has it's negative side as well. And there<br />are many other reasons why I see major price drop not as possible but certain, even though asset exchange might pump the price up for a while (check how it (didn't) really<br />worked with Mastercoin and Counterparty).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>From my experience, this &quot;proven&quot; bitcoin code is quite messy, complicated and prone to errors. Contrast that with NXT core, which is super clean and organized. jean-luc has totally transformed the code quality. While future bugs on Curve25519 might be possible, if we are afraid of quantum computers, then most of crypto is worthless.<br /><br />Note that the bitcoin malleability issue, even after all of the media uproar has yet to be fixed. NXT malleability issue, already fixed. NXT is evolving like the mammals did while the dinosaurs just watched. NXT might be like small little critters compared to bitcoin dinosaur, but if you project the technical progress that is possible, then anybody that does that research will conclude that NXT is quite undervalued.<br /><br />When you say it didnt work for Mastercoin and Counterparty, I guess being in the top 10 of all crypto is a failure?<br /><br />Anyway, if you are so convinced NXT is overpriced, then I will take it off your hands. I have some extra DRK, we can trade them at current market price of 100:1<br /><br />James

					If you have 1 million+ NXT and interested in becoming part of a future project, PM me.<br />By summer, I expect most of my current batch of projects will be in the maintenance stage, so the investment timeframe will be ~6 months. I wont accept any funds until there is a clear plan for monetization, but it would help to know the level of interest.<br /><br />I expect this future project to be the last one that I will make available for investment as between it and improving InstantDEX and maintaining community projects, even I will be saturated<br /><br />James

					InstantDEX will be issued and distributed on launch day, however there will be no official or unofficial IPO. There never was a public investment window to make sure that we avoid any regulatory issues. That being said I cannot control what people do with the InstantDEX they have. I expect that some people might put some up for sale on the AE, especially if there are bids. The only price point for InstantDEX to date is 7.5 NXT per InstantDEX asset.<br /><br />There will be 1,000,000 InstantDEX issued.<br />jl777 30%<br />wesleyh 30%<br />aldrin 20%<br />consultants and advisors 9% (Come-from-Beyond, AdamLevine, fanaticalfishing, chanc3r, joefox, NXTminnow, allwelder)<br />InstantDEX working capital 11%<br /><br />InstantDEX will generate revenues by charging 0.1% to 0.2% of transactions. If it is 0.2% to each side of the trade, that is a total of 0.4% of all trade volume. If InstantDEX is able to sustain a daily trade volume of 250 BTC -&gt; 1 BTC/day of revenues.<br /><br />InstantDEX will launch by supporting trading in multigateway assets, but it is asset agnostic and can be used for trading any NXT asset. Due to the tech not being completed yet, there is no launch date for InstantDEX. The main tech components are a UDP hole punching peer to peer comm system that enables not only realtime trade matching, but off blockchain nearly atomic trade settlements. Due to the differences in bitcoind forks (NXTsubatomic) and NXT transactions (NXTatomic), it is not clear yet if there is a way to directly connect the two types of trades. In that event multigateway services might be required. Also due to transaction malleability issues, it is not clear how many confirmations will be needed to be able to safely finalize trades.<br /><br />InstantDEX will let people change their bid/ask without fees and only charge when a trade happens. The goal of InstantDEX is to provide a fully decentralized peer-to-peer realtime trustless trading environment. There is no guarantee that this ideal goal will be 100% achieved, but I will continue to innovate and improve the tech to get as close as possible. I believe that it is important to provide the market what the market wants, instead of forcing something against what the market wants. To that end, InstantDEX will allow for trading of any NXT asset, NXT, bitcoind crypto against each other. I will also test market using ripple IOU&#039;s for USD and CNY to see if such a proxy of a proxy will be acceptable for traders. If it is, then it will be fully integrated into InstantDEX<br /><br />Wesleyh will work hard to make InstantDEX as easy to use as possible. Since we wont have large server expenses no matter how many active traders there are, our overhead will be the lowest in the industry. This will allow InstantDEX to have lower fees initially to gain marketshare. Exact specifics on fees are subject to change, with reasonable notice given to the customers.<br /><br />It is expected that half the revenues will be distributed to InstantDEX holders, but probably not until there is an easy to use dividend mechanism. Exact distribution amounts and timing are subject to change. InstantDEX currently has over 1.5 million NXT 4383817337783094122 and I do not expect that we will need any additional capital to fund continued operations.<br /><br />NXTsubatomic and NXTatomic will be part of InstantDEX. I believe both have no fundamental security issues, but due to the cutting edge nature of their implementation, it is possible for there to be incidents. We will of course do our best to avoid any such incidents, just a risk factor to keep in mind. Also, in the event that I or anybody else solves the BTC &lt;-&gt; NXT direct atomic exchange, I will of course integrate that tech into InstantDEX.<br /><br />I cant make any promises about availability of InstantDEX, but if people posted their interest, that could help some of the holders to decide to put some up for sale.<br /><br />The following threads have info on the progress of the tech:<br /><a href="https://nxtforum.org/multigateway-jl777/nxtsubatomic-atomic-crosschain-exchange/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/multigateway-jl777/nxtsubatomic-atomic-crosschain-exchange/</a> and <a href="https://nxtforum.org/multigateway-jl777/secret-project/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/multigateway-jl777/secret-project/</a><br /><br />James<br />
