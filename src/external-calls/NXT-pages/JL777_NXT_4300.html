There are Mac, windows and ubuntu versions.<br /><br />Also changed tokenized URL that NXTservices generates to automatically generate the tokenized URL and resubmit. I realized there is no security gained by requiring the user (or GUI) to cut and paste the tokenized URL. The key is that only the locally running NXTservices and NXTcore is able to generate the valid token and since I am verifying locally, might as well bypass a step.<br /><br />NXTorrent change for poofknuckle who will now beg me for a testnet version <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />misc bug fixes<br /><br />When we move to production servers your multisig deposit addresses will change. The NXT AE assets will be the same ones but you will need to get new deposit addresses and withdraw addresses. During the switchover, MGW will be offline and I should be able to transfer the balances over seamlessly.<br /><br />It is also possible that you wont have a deposit address as I think a couple of them got errors when I forced the servers to generate them, so if you dont see a deposit address just generate one.<br /><br />I am still testing the basics, so as of now M08c is totally experimental.<br /><br />James<br /><br />

					I just realized I goofed. I didnt have to manually send out the assets as MGW will automatically recover and send them! This means you will probably get a double deposit of assets. Also, not sure about the withdraws, I dont think anything will happen as the record of them is on testnet, so once I get the accounts hacked in their, reprocess, everyone should get their current balances<br /><br />It is sort of a mess, but everyone will have to see what their new balance is and compare it to what it should be. No one should have less, but some of you could have a lot more. Please send any amount you got above the initial transfer I sent to you into the genesis acct<br /><br />We need to recreate the accurate balances. Sorry for the mistake. I didnt realize MGW was able to regenerate all deposits, but not the withdraws. I guess I never designed to do this, so not too surprising.<br /><br />James

Only usa can do this as all international trade is based on usd, for almost 100 years now. People forget UK used to enjoy this, but it never lasts forever, probably because having a ~40% cushion just makes you lazy and complacent. Other countries without the benefit of free money learn to compete and survive and soon USA will need to go on the same basis.<br /><br />I dont have much experience with gold market so I am not going to do any price speculating, might as well randomly guess if you are not super familiar with a specific market<br /><br />Not sure there will be a rate hike, remember I said it will be deliberately confused so few people will be able to understand what is actually happening. politicos + massive TV + media are very good at getting the &quot;right message&quot; out there. If USA were soviet union, people would call it propaganda!<br /><br />Capital controls are already beginning this summer to trap any USD still there, [advice: if you are able extract USD to where it is out of reach of usa]<br />Price controls will probably kick in along with other things to make things look normal for as long as possible. Not sure if there is election this november, if there is then probably right after is when all this happens. Just guessing, maybe everything will magically work out for another 20 years. Why not just keep spending all that fiat? Maybe nobody will notice.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The US / European economies are in shambles because of government policies encouraging outsourcing and un&quot;fair trade&quot;.&nbsp; The unions are to blame too.&nbsp; When was the last time you bought something and it said &quot;Made in the USA&quot;?&nbsp; I haven't seen an actual USA manufactured product in ages.&nbsp; After I couldn't purchase USA made products, I tried to purchase European made goods, but those are all but gone now too.&nbsp; It's ridiculous.&nbsp; Everything is made in China and the quality is pathetic.&nbsp; Also, I don't want to purchase goods from a country which holds opposing views and support their political agenda.<br /><br />There is no real manufacturing base anymore and entire regions have been economically decimated.&nbsp; Since the capital in these areas has been drained, they are dead and now reliant upon the government for subsidies.&nbsp; I don't want to pay for a subsidy for someone when they could be producing superior manufactured goods that I want.&nbsp; Stable economies are balanced with both manufacturing and service jobs.<br /><br />These policies will come back to haunt us if we ever face a conflict with China (or other countries where jobs have been outsourced) and need to mass produce supplies.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My view is that China already won the conflict.<br />First they offered usa super cheap labor and manufacturing knowing the profit based companies would all &quot;outsource&quot;<br />Second they bought all the debt usa would issue and it was a ton to fully finance all of usa's follies<br />Third they wait until the right moment (when revenues cant meet interest payments) and then stop buying debt, massive sale, remove USD from global reserve currency status (lobbying other countries based on all the debt usa has!)<br /><br />Now, usa is in no position to do anything. Surviving the coming economic crisis without martial law will be a challenge enough. During this time, China will go on to step Four, where they advance on all fronts like tech, manuf, medicine, etc. to&nbsp; become the only superpower and maybe they make RMB or a proxy of it the new global currency<br /><br />Sorry to break the bad news to usa peoples, the facts are all there for you to verify.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S.

No, it wasnt my prediction at .00007 <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />It was insider buying by chinese investors who found out about the btc38.com listing of NXT and bter starting payout of 1% interest. NXT/BTC volumes at bter did a healthy double+ from average, but NEM purchases alone could account for that. On the NXT/CNY side the volumes went up 15 to 20 times. Yes, that is almost ten times the amount NXT/BTC gained, so to me it is pretty clear that this whole spike was something that could not be stopped. Arbitrage guaranteed that NXT/BTC will quickly match NXT/CNY<br /><br />Anyway, maybe I am just lucky or maybe I actually know a few things about how crypto markets work.

So, you need to find reliable research on this. It might not be a sudden event, but when I see nearly infinite debt turn what used to be the worlds richest country into arguable the world's poorest country, well that at some point will be felt by the people of usa<br /><br />Being able to literally print money has allowed all sorts of funny business to be done, but as that ability is reduced or eliminated, then obtaining foreign goods will have to start reflecting reality, so expect doubling of the cost of all imports. <br /><br />Of course the usa govt is full of people much smarter than me, so maybe this is all under control and trillions of debt whose interest cant be paid is a simple problem to solve for them.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S.

Why not just keep spending all that fiat? Maybe nobody will notice.<br /><br />James

Just wanted to point out (in case it's not obvious) that migrating the assets to the mainnet means that folks will likely have to use their testnet pass phrase on the mainnet to access the mainnet-equivalent of the testnet accounts. <br /><br />It's not problematic, but since we generally recommend that people do not mix testnet and mainnet accounts, this might blur the lines a little.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>yes, I hope I made it clear. but it is the reverse that is much danger. using testnet on mainnet exposes the testnet acct as most people are not so careful with their testnet passwords. I even saw some posted!<br />This is the reason I generate a custom NXTservices acct to isolate it from your main acct<br /><br />By limiting the test acct to deposit/withdraw and xfer to main acct, I dont see much risk other than what is in the test acct during testing. So dont put 10000 NXT in the test acct!<br />just need enough NXT for asset xfers and AM's<br /><br />James<br /><br />mainnet -&gt; testnet bad<br />testnet -&gt; mainnet ok as long as test acct small

I am a huge fan of crowd psychology and this action is just a result of accumulation, whatever the reasons maybe.<br /><br />I think it was Baruch or maybe O´Neil who named this. <br /><br />btw. gold is shooting up, some news coming from the fed i suppose or its the oil price correlation.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>oil countries not using petrodollar anymore, settling contracts for oil in gold. might be a cause<br />USD is being phased out by the world as the reserve currency, all the other countries worried (rightly) about large scale defaults coming soon. China has made new deals with many countries to settle in their currency,etc.<br /><br />Watch for some late Friday govt announcement about some emergency currency issues with a lot of confusing mumbo jumbo. The net effect will be ~40% overnight inflation of USD. This is the only way to meet debt obligations without selling off federal assets like the Grand Canyon or simply abolishing social security and all the subsidy programs. <br /><br />James

Do other countries do horrible things like this, of course. But usa is one of the leaders in this area, it is just VERY VERY good at PR<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. If you need more examples of usa oppression, let me know. Stuff like classifying all cryptography as a weapon. Did you know that if it werent for Bernstein&#039;s suit against USA, just by using bitcoin, NXT or any crypto you could have been legally sent to jail for many years?

					NXT has gone from ~7 cents to 7.6 cents since I posted my prediction about NXT moving from .00012 to .00015 range<br /><br />the angle of the long term moving average continues to be diagonally up, with the short term riding above it. It is possible for a little softness as the short term can come down to the long term,but when all time periods are going up, the trend is your friend.<br /><br />Maybe we will find a dry basketball in the near future or wet one, not sure what that pic means?<br /><br />After analyzing the spike to .00016, I figured out the cause. No, it wasnt my prediction at .00007 <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />It was insider buying by chinese investors who found out about the btc38.com listing of NXT and bter starting payout of 1% interest. NXT/BTC volumes at bter did a healthy double+ from average, but NEM purchases alone could account for that. On the NXT/CNY side the volumes went up 15 to 20 times. Yes, that is almost ten times the amount NXT/BTC gained, so to me it is pretty clear that this whole spike was something that could not be stopped. Arbitrage guaranteed that NXT/BTC will quickly match NXT/CNY<br /><br />Anyway, maybe I am just lucky or maybe I actually know a few things about how crypto markets work. You decide<br /><br />James
