How many years must we wait? I mean come on man!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No amount of heckling or sarcasm will make my statements any less true. If you don't have anything useful to say and want to be a clown then that is your problem.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think it is fair to say that I have had at least a small role in creating the crypto asset business category. I communicated this concept by getting people to think of the crypto businesses like normal businesses. Have to start somewhere. However, there are at least two very significant differences, which leads to a totally different dynamic. Of course the most obvious is the decentralization, which makes it a lot more difficult technically, but a lot more robust and secure when solved. This is however a secondary thing, as if it doesnt work, nobody cares if it is secure or not.<br /><br />Not sure if you are familiar with Security Analysis, fundamental valuation of a security and viewing crypto assets (or anything) like this is the best way. It is simply the lifetime amount of distributions that will be received, discounted to present value. For a traditional business, you just take the annual dividends and multiply by how long the business is expected to live, ie PE. For crypto assets a lot of people are using a model more like that for growth stocks before there are profits, which makes sense as clearly promising companies without profits clearly have a value more than 0. So revenue multiples are used. PS ratio. But what if there are no revenues yet? Now we get into the VC/angel valuations territory, where the critical factors are market potential and burn rate and amount of capital to burn.<br /><br />Notice 2 of the 3 critical factors for VC valuations are irrelevant for my crypto business assets.<br /><br />This is something that most of crypto investors still do not understand and explains why they are so worried about deadlines (real or imagined) as missing a deadline could literally mean death of the asset. Instead of the amount of capital and burn rate, the most important thing about crypto assets are the people behind the asset, their skills and dedication. Instead of a project lasting as long as the money is there, a project lasts as long as the devs are there. So now the equation is Potential * P(devs completing before bailing) discounted by expected time to complete<br /><br />What this means is that with a dedicated team behind an asset that is not based on salaries, office space, etc. there is no clock ticking away to a &quot;sorry we ran out of funds and have to close&quot; deadline. This means we have time to experiment to make the best possible solution, and we will.<br /><br />Has my demonstrated past years of working 16+ hours per day (with the occasional day off) made you think that I am an incompetent dev? Do you feel that I will just abandon everybody who have supported me? Due to the time uncertainity, I sold SuperNET assets at very close to the NAV, so I feel that I should have the time required to do the tech properly without undue time pressure. <br /><br />Regardless of when exactly I started coding for crypto (end of Feb 2014), the relevant start time as far as SuperNET goes is when the funds were raised, which is about 6 months ago. During this past half year a 500+ SuperNET community with dozens of projects SPONTANEOUSLY formed. Now this is good, very good and one of the biggest values of SuperNET, but it does take about half my time away as every day in a community of 500, things happen that I need to get involved in. So I am coding about halftime (for me that is ~60hrs per week) though I do have some 100 hour stretches of pure coding with ~10 hrs of naps interspersed.<br /><br />I originally estimated about 6 months to complete my tech, but the extra time the much bigger community has made this longer, however I doubt it will be double as there are many who are helping me directly. Now I am adding support for multilanguage plugins, so any of a dozen languages can be used to extend SuperNET API. Even now SuperNET is far more than just me, but with the new plugins, I will become even less of a factor.<br /><br />Since my dedication cant be questioned by any reasonable person, maybe I am just not having the needed skills? Is that your assessment? If so, please find a more capable dev and I will hire him. However, if my dedication and skills are not in question and time to complete is a secondary factor, and if you don't have anything useful to say and want to be a troll then that is your problem.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. recently I had a CfB brain transplant so now I feel that I do understand crypto a lot better, though I still need to get the practical experience via experimentations.

More than a year on and the only thing I see really tangible that works is the malfunctioning mgw. There's a scrapyard 20 projects high of half way there projects that are apparently getting worked on with no documentation, code review or evidence that anything is actually going to work or even be completed. Neodice for example:<br /><br />[22:18] &lt;jl777&gt; neodice found some issues during testing<br />[22:18] &lt;jl777&gt; they devised a solution and implemented it, well currrently they are debugging it<br />[22:19] &lt;jones&gt; malleability issue?<br />[22:19] &lt;jl777&gt; so it is just more difficult than originally expected, but there is definitely work being made on it<br />[22:19] &lt;jl777&gt; i think so<br /><br /><br />That last part. &quot;I think so&quot;. Lol, seriously. If JL doesn't know if his own project is being worked on or what's going on how can anyone have confidence after all this time. Neodice was supposed to be completed a long time ago. I am not trolling. Seriously, show me one other completed project that is part of supernet other than some malfunctioning mgw servers and a gui... I've seen lots of &quot;screenshots&quot;. I can't count on my hands how many times I've read &quot;project x is ready to be released next week.&quot; Then nothing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>please exaggerate the timeframes even more and take what I said out of context. SuperNET didnt start until about 6 months ago. I stated that neodice is definitely being worked on. the &quot;i think so&quot; was regards to the malleability issue.<br /><br />I am NOT micromanaging the various projects, but I am publishing my source code during development, so if that isnt evidence enough for you, then what to do? Maybe I should stop coding and spend time documenting things? How does that help? Should I spend my time micromanaging all the other projects or coding?<br /><br />the old MGW has been rewritten to fix its issues, that code is from last year. Also FreeMarket has been out for quite a while and there are test releases for several other projects.<br /><br />From a financial side, UNITY price has doubled in terms of NXT and has held pretty close to the ICO price all during these last 2 years. Now if you know anybody else that can code all this better than me, then please let me know who that is. I am making very good progress and I have been working 16+ hours per day for the last 7 years, it is just a matter of time before SuperNET is completed.<br /><br />James<br />

Imagine if he didnt demonstrate his exploit this weekend, his claims would likely have been dismisssed.<br /><br />So, unless all four of his exploits are silly (ie SHA256 collisions, or requiring reversing curve25519) then I will likely release the funds as it will benefit us all to have someone like him (regardless of how you feel about his behavior) constantly trying to find real world exploits so he can get another 50,000 NXT<br /><br />James

He tried to exploit it; and on MainNet, not TestNet. Only when the bug was fixed, making further attacks impossible, did he come forward and claim responsibility for the attack. So, we shouldn't reward him for that first bug. By the time he'd come forward, Jean-Luc had already fixed it, and his coming forward didn't help with that bug.<br /><br />Other bugs, yes. He says he has a second similar DoS bug, plus some others, and the first bug does at least establish his credibility as a bug-finder.

Now the latter did it in a lot more responsible way, but it was also tested out on mainnet as testnet behavior is never the same as mainnet.<br /><br />As a community, we need to reward people that find exploits, so they will get more by reporting and cooperating, than using the exploits.<br /><br />If a car mechanic tells you that your car isnt safe to drive (and he knows how to fix it), will you be debating whether he should have gotten your carpet all dirty? or that he used bad language when he communicated it to you? I think the important thing is that there is credible evidence that there could be some exploits that can be practically deployed. Even if they are only theoretical, NXT will be better off for fixing these vulnerabilities. And this weekend the stop and start of the blockchain was a lot more than a theoretical exploit even if no funds were lost.<br /><br />James

					bad news is that plugin.h, host side handler and the baseline plugin code is getting much more complicated...<br /><br />jl777 [9:50 AM]<br />however, I just got a new style plugin to compile that supports dynamically extending the SuperNET API<br /><br />jl777 [9:51 AM]<br />and theoretically the plugin can be bundled and use in process messaging, or run as a separate process, or even on a different node, but the last one is not guaranteed<br /><br />jl777 [9:52 AM]<br />the important usecase for bundling is I can bundle things like sophia for blockchain creation and any other type of key/value store that is needed (there are many)<br /><br />jl777 [9:53 AM]<br />so with the dynamic API extensibility and inprocess bundled plugins that use the identical code for independent process (and external node) the only problem is that the &quot;basic&quot; plugin that is needed for each language isnt so basic anymore...<br /><br />jl777 [9:54 AM]<br />An alternate way to use a new language is to make it C callable and then the good news is that you can use the new slimmed down demo plugin:<br /><br />jl777 [9:54 AM]<br />#define PLUGINSTR echo<br />STRUCTNAME<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;// this will be at the end of the plugins structure and will be called with all zeros to _init<br />};<br />char *PLUGNAME(_methods)[] = { &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;echo2&quot; }; // list of supported methods<br /><br />uint64_t PLUGNAME(_init)(struct plugin_info *plugin,STRUCTNAME *data)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;uint64_t disableflags = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;// runtime specific state can be created and put into *data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;return(disableflags); // set bits corresponding to array position in _methods[]<br />}<br /><br />int32_t PLUGNAME(_process_json)(struct plugin_info *plugin,char *retbuf,int32_t maxlen,char *jsonstr,cJSON *json,int32_t initflag)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;char *str;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;retbuf[0] = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if ( initflag &gt; 0 )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// configure settings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;str = stringifyM(jsonstr);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sprintf(retbuf,&quot;{\&quot;args\&quot;:%s,\&quot;milliseconds\&quot;:%f,\&quot;onetime\&quot;:%d}\n&quot;,str,milliseconds(),initflag &lt; 0);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;free(str);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;return((int32_t)strlen(retbuf));<br />}<br /><br />int32_t PLUGNAME(_shutdown)(struct plugin_info *plugin,int32_t retcode) (edited)<br /><br />jl777 [9:54 AM]<br />using some compile time magic, just by changing a few #define you can change whether it is bundled or not. The main function is the _process_json<br /><br />jl777 [9:55 AM]<br />this function processes json sent to the plugin. you have to distinguish between several contexts:<br /><br />jl777 [9:55 AM]<br />1: this is called during init time and things are not running yet<br /><br />jl777 [9:56 AM]<br />0: this is called during runtime and for both initflag modes, you need to check whether your instance is the permanent one or a websocket spawn<br /><br />jl777 [9:56 AM]<br />-1: this is possible if it is a onetime invokation, ie not daemonized<br /><br />jl777 [9:59 AM]<br />_methods is an array of strings for the methods your plugin will support. To the rest of SuperNET, the &quot;requestType&quot;:&quot;echo&quot;, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;&lt;any of _methods&gt;&quot; will be used to route the JSON request to the permanent plugin. any tagging needed to correlate return JSON with the original request is up to the plugin as a lot of use cases can be done totally stateless and this is an unnecessary complexity<br /><br />jl777 [10:00 AM]<br />the _shutdown is just called before this instance is shutdown, either due to your _process_json returning negative value to trigger an shutdown or because the parent process (SuperNET that launched plugin) died<br /><br />jl777 [10:01 AM]<br />finally (or initially) the _init plugin is passed a pointer to a echo_info data structure (all zeroes) before things are started and you can disable any of the first 64 methods based on runtime factors.<br /><br />jl777 [10:02 AM]<br />how does SuperNET know how much space to allocate for your data? just put whatever fields you need inside the STRUCTNAME, that macro expands out to struct echo_info and for each plugin it will end up as struct &lt;name of plugin&gt;_info<br /><br />jl777 [10:03 AM]<br />You do need to #define PLUGINSTR to echo (without quotes!)<br /><br />jl777 [10:03 AM]<br />Steps to make your own plugin:<br /><br />jl777 [10:03 AM]<br />1. make a copy of echodemo.c and change the #define's with echo to the name of your pluging<br /><br />jl777 [10:04 AM]<br />2. fill out the STRUCTNAME() fields<br /><br />jl777 [10:04 AM]<br />3. add the different methods you will support in _methods array<br /><br />jl777 [10:05 AM]<br />4. write _init and shutdown functions, usually it can just be to do nothing as things are all setup for the normal cases, you just get a chance to do whatever you need to at the important points<br /><br />jl777 [10:05 AM]<br />5. the above should take just a few minutes, the rest of the time is about processing the json API request and copy it into the retbuf<br /><br />jl777 [10:06 AM]<br />You will notice that there is no threading to deal with, no nanomsg, no networking, nothing other than what your plugin needs to do
