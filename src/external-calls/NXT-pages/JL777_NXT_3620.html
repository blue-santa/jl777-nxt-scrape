So it is safe to expect another update next Monday.<br /><br />Sadly everything is going a in a slow pace but it is mostly because of external variables. While old statements are basically unchanged, the current status regarding some ventures, Here is a refresher with some new information.<br /><br /><strong>- RBTrade:</strong><br />We are approaching several individuals with high skills and work ethics to work on the automated trading engine but currently it is a one man show (Lophie). It is sadly going slowly but it is being done &quot;the right way&quot;. In two weeks his schedule is planned to shift to an 8 hours daily dedicated development of RBTrade. We will have an engine that efficiently connects to multitude of exchanges fully utilizing the APIs and with an automated analysis of markets it Scalps, arbitrages, hedges and much more. <br /><br /><strong>-Bitcoin Gateway and SMS gateway:</strong><br />The gateway is done and now we are just polishing the code waiting for the fees to get lower on NXT network plus a few other variables.<br /><br /><strong>- Investment ventures:</strong><br />We are waiting for ASICMINER to start dispersing dividends and MultiGateway being fully operational to start offering MCXNow. Also lowering the fees for order placement is another accounted for factor<br /><br /><strong>- The plugin system:</strong><br />We are still pushing for that and addressing all the concerns of security by the developers. Such a platform is needed to deploy our services. So we will help making it.<br /><br />I (Lophie) took a personal responsibility for my decision for hedging the value of the fund outside NXT to BTC and other forms which I can happily inform you guys that it helped us retain the previous value of the NXT we hedged. We currently can take the funds back into NXT with 20% additional NXT or more.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">We want to again mention that Supercell Investment is taking the slow lane to profits and growth because we want to be here to stay. Thank you for investing with us with a similar mindset.</span><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you get a chance, please check out the InstantDEX API that is part of the&nbsp; pNXTlite client<br /><a href="https://nxtforum.org/nxtservices-releases/(alpha-t10)-instantdex-alpha-release-includes-initial-privacyserver-support/msg63971/#msg63971" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/nxtservices-releases/(alpha-t10)-instantdex-alpha-release-includes-initial-privacyserver-support/msg63971/#msg63971</a><br /><br />I definitely want to support &#039;bot trading!<br /><br />James

					Fixed the missing first message error. it turned out to be a minimal size queue edge case in a super low level library call! All my code uses it and all along it had this chance for a bug. Another advantage of multiple projects using the same code, each project ends up testing out the lower level codes from a slightly different angle. I dont think this would have caused any MGW issues as with MGW all the queues get stretched pretty big, the error happened only on first entry when it is emptied, or something that is rare for some use cases, but quite common for chat tracking.<br /><br />Anyway, after the game today I was not so feeling good. Actually still recovering from recent flu and it seems I relapsed a bit <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br />So when feeling this bad, what to do?<br />Port to 32-bit windows <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />cant really feel much worse so might as well do the dreaded visual studio, et.all<br /><br />What do you know, just copying the MGW project making a few changes and presto! it seems to work, so here it is:<br /><br /><a href="http://209.126.70.170/pNXTlite.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.70.170/pNXTlite.zip</a> with both win32 and Mac versions of the thin client. The :7777 page should show up and you can make fake orderbook entries <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Note that the IP is different from what it was before! When I added DDOS protection, the IP address had to change<br /><br />209.126.71.170 -&gt; 209.126.70.170<br /><br />If you want to run your own pNXTd privacyServer:<br /><a href="http://209.126.70.170/pNXT" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.70.170/pNXT</a> for Ubuntu only<br /><br />There is rapid development on pNXTd so no guarantees about any stability or compatibility. For now, just want people to give feedback on orderbook<br /><br />James

					I am very excited to be able to be part of a multipool with meaningful TH<br /><br />The most interesting part about this asset is the relatively fast expected return of capital. Of course with mining difficulty always going up, it is a constant battle to maintain profitability, but that is why the multipool aspect is so important. As long as there continue to be new gen1 coins in the early stages of mining, we can be mining at decent profitabilities.<br /><br />The most important aspect of the plan is the compounding of hashrate by using a meaningful percentage of proceeds to acquire new hardware. As each generation of ASIC (or other new fangled hardware) comes out, by having the funds ready to purchase the latest hardware, we hope to maintain one of the better returns, so while the original hardware being purchased now might (will) go obsolete over time, as long as we have the newest hardware with the most efficient hashrate, the future is bright.<br /><br />How long this bright future lasts depends on the market and that is not possible to predict, so we will just need to make sure it makes sense to continue reinvesting. This might mean a buildup of capital reserves while we wait for the nextgen hardware to become available at some point.<br /><br />I have done some rough calculations and 60% payout, 40% reinvestment is the current sweet spot that returns capital the soonest while maximizing the active hashrate at the time of returning the initial capital. So, no guarantees on time for capital return, but in the mining business the timeframe cannot be 1 year. And I do expect to get the capital back and then some much sooner than that.<br /><br />Of course, we need to see the first actual numbers coming in before we can solidify any projections. I have sent in the first part of the capital promised (11.5 BTC of 34 BTC) and as soon as things can get ramped up, the rest will follow.<br /><br />Also, I was thinking that a lot of times there could be no point for converting the mined coin to BTC to NXT, especially if there is no market or it is a thin market with high spreads. Maybe there will be an option to &quot;directly&quot; send out the mined coins in the form of MGW assets.<br /><br />First things first, gotta get the hardware purchased and in service!<br /><br />James

					Thank you for your analysis. I did some probability calcs that show that MGW is actually significantly more secure than a centralized gateway.<br /><br />1. Server redundancy is quite a benefit, especially when you consider blockchain forks. For a centralized gateway if their server (for any coin) goes on a fork, well, problems. With MGW, at least on the withdraw side everything comes to a stop. Granted response time isnt good, but I think stopping all withdraws until the fork is resolved is really the only practical solution and MGW design does this automatically. Also, MGW uses the blockchains as its database, thats pretty redundant.<br /><br />2. your assumption of &quot;if he can find an other host whatever method worked on the first one would probably work on the second&quot; is flawed. The three MGW hosts will be proving three different sets of operational security, each based on their own proprietary security procedures. Its not like there will be a magic incantation that opens all the pathways to the MGW private keys. Now even it there was, it wont be as simple as doing a sendmoney call as all the funds are in multisig accts. Maybe this is not a big issue, but also, there wont be a single large account, but lots of small accounts. So, this magical hacker needs to crack one server host then while undetected crack another MGW host, then deal with hundreds or thousands of accounts. All without being detected as once detected, everything can be shutdown. Now how exactly the hacker will even contact an MGW server externally is a mystery to me. In any case, MGW doesnt have to run faster than the bear, it just needs to be more secure than a centralized setup. I think a social engineering hack is the weakest link, but whatever the exposure the odds are P*P vs P, where P is the probability of being cracked. Add to that the difficulty of multisig tx, add to that the lack of a centralized account. Whatever those factors are, call it X factor we have MGW being (X / P) more secure. So, if odds of one facility being cracked are .001 and X factor is 5, MGW is 5000 times more secure.<br /><br />3. MGW is open. Meaning anybody can do a realtime audit on all the account balances and compare against the outstanding assets. In fact, the MGW client does this when configured with bitcoin-qt. I dont know of any centralized gateway that lets you verify they have 100% backing. Fractional reserve is always a tempting thing, but with MGW it is not possible. This is something that you overlook and I think could be one of the most powerful MGW advantages. You dont have to trust the issuer to not do fractional reserve, it is all there on the blockchain and the MGW clients can monitor this block by block. So in this most important sense, MGW is trustless. Realtime verification of unspent reserves.<br /><br />MGW is thousands of times more secure than centralized gateways. MGW does NOT require trust that it has 100% reserve. MGW has lower target appeal due to no central wallet and multisig. MGW utilizes blockchain redundancy for its state data and is more immune to blockchain forks. MGW is monitored by all independent nodes running the MGW client (which is 95% the same code as MGW server) to obtain realtime verification of all MGW operations, eg. deposits and withdraws. <br /><br />Now a totally blockchain solution is of course theoretically much more desirable, but I am not smart enough to figure out how to do it. The fundamental problem is &quot;where are the private keys&quot;. If you can figure out how to store the private keys on the blockchain without allowing anybody to just empty the accounts, then let me know and I will implement it. To my knowledge, MGW is far and away the most secure gateway solution with the least trust required of any gateway in existence.<br /><br />Basically, technically it is the best. The bottomline is users have to use either a centralized exchange, a centralized gateway or MGW. Well, OK, I guess people can use NXTsubatomic/NXTatomic and not have to deposit their bitcoins anywhere. Maybe for people like you that seem to want to eliminate all third party risk, that is the way to go. I do understand your point of view. So the best gateway is no gateway at all!<br /><br />Thanks for the thoughtful questions. It always helps to verify my thinking when put up against intelligent probing<br /><br />James<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/nxtservices-releases/how-to-test-multigateway-with-nxtservices-a-test-user-guide/msg64349/#msg64349">Quote from: sile16 on July 14, 2014, 03:43:33 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Correct me if i'm wrong but the the MGW release still requires trust of the asset issuer.&nbsp; From an end user point of view MGW would look identical to a single server implementation of a gateway.&nbsp; (assuming the same GUI).&nbsp; So, really all the MGW does is give more confidence that the server architecture is more resilient.<br /><br />Benefits of MGW vs Single server Gateway assuming same GUI interface:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Server redundancy in case of hardware failure, always remaining 2 servers provide ability to release funds.&nbsp; <br />2.&nbsp; Potentially slightly better security.&nbsp; I say slightly because, 2 hosts would have to be compromised, but assuming a hacker can compromise 1 host, and all 3 hosts are running the same OS, and MGW software then if he can find an other host whatever method worked on the first one would probably work on the second.&nbsp; As for finding the hosts, it seems like you could just crossreference all the IPs of BTC nodes as well as NXT nodes.&nbsp; However, if MGW was re-implemented 3 times by 3 different programers and secured (os, firewall, etc) 3 unique ways it could achieve significantly higher security.<br />3.&nbsp; Any other benefits of MGW that i'm missing?<br /><br /><br />Could a trustless MGW solution be built directly into NXT?&nbsp; The fundamental problem with this is managing the private keys on the Bitcoin side.&nbsp; There really is no way for the NXT chain to hold keys in a way for a shared pool.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I think what could be built is a special AE for external assets.&nbsp; So, instead of having bitcoins go into a pool and then flow out, (which would require handling private keys), we do direct exchange of BTC for NXT via this special AE.&nbsp; So, direct user to user Bitcoin &lt;-&gt; NXT transfers are done.&nbsp; <br /><br />1.&nbsp; Special AE for BTC &lt;-&gt; NXT<br />2.&nbsp; Sell orders of NXT can be placed, in the sell order, a receiving address would be generated (by the client automitically or the user could specify their own)&nbsp; Would also specify a minimum amount of fees for the transaction, either as % or total amount of NXT.<br />3.&nbsp; A buy order is placed (from an NXT wallet), (buying NXT with BTC), could potentially pay higher than minimum fee amount to get more votes.<br />4.&nbsp; The user has to manually complete the bitcoin transaction, a QR code will provide the payment address.<br />5.&nbsp; Some rule would specify that the BTC has to be in target address within 24-48 hours with 48+ confirmations or whatever. Biggest challenge here is transacations that don't make it into the blockchain.&nbsp; If a transaction was sent out that never got confirmed in the timeframe and then for whatever reason got confirmed later that user may be out some bitcoin ... or it gets complicated.&nbsp; Would have to think about the best way to handle all cases.<br />6.&nbsp; A vote would happen by NXT nodes weighted by stake.&nbsp; These nodes would be checking bitcoin balances and vote.<br />7.&nbsp; Nodes would be encouraged to vote by paying out the couple of percentage points to a voting member based on a hash of the block with the final vote results<br />8.&nbsp; Once the vote is completed, the next block would include the NXT transfer based on results of vote and paying to the winning vote member.<br /><br />Security is based on 51% of the voting nodes to be acting honestly.&nbsp; Voting nodes ideally would be DDOS resistant to reduce chances of someone altering the vote by trying to take honest nodes offline.<br /><br />Note, that the BTC transfer is being traded directly from user-&gt; user, so at no time is an NXT node in control of the Bitcoin, we only verify if the BTC transaction completes and move the NXT according based on the votes.<br /><br />Partial orders and limit orders:<br />Partial orders could happen although each one would require a seperate vote and thus require a lot more fees to get a safe transfer.&nbsp; Limit orders, having a limit order seems like it would be more problematic, since order matching is an interactive process it seems that only NXT sell orders could have a limit.&nbsp; On the Buy of NXT, it would all require market orders, meaning that you put in a price it either gets confirmed immediatly or it doesn't go through at all, so a user would put in a buy order and then a couple minutes later would get the Bitcoin QR code to complete the transaction every time. <br /><br />Obviously this requires changes to NXT core to achieve this but this seems much more plausible than trying to implement some method of holding bitcoin private keys.&nbsp; <br /><br />Other down sides are that the amount of fees may be pretty high to ensure security from the voting pool.&nbsp; Another nice thing is that all forging nodes can complete their operations without any external bitcoin code.&nbsp; Only the voting nodes need to have some link into the actual Bitcoin Blockchain.<br /><br />Not sure how high those fees would be but if they are too high someone may just utilize a trusted gateway instead.&nbsp; People could have the option of paying 5% for a decentralized voting based trade of BTC-&gt;NXT or instead use the multigateway which requires trust but has lower fees.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I think I have a good understanding of how you intend this to work. Effectively, there'll be a pNXT&lt;&gt;NXT gateway. After you sell off all the pNXT, then this gateway will be 100% NXT. This gateway will always enforce the peg (whatever it gets set to). The pNXT to NXT conversions won't have to rely 100% on this gateway because once the system is up and running, the privacyServers can trade smaller amounts (safe in the knowledge that the peg is always in place.)<br /><br />I'm unsure about the sell 100% plan. The centralization issue is still there. If you sell all the pNXT for 10million NXT and hold 100% reserves, there's still 10million NXT in one place publicly securing the pNXT tokens. For the MGW, you have 3 servers that need to agree and each bitcoin deposit account doesn't have that much in it, and the system will shut down when it detects something out of the normal. How is the NXT/pNXT gateway secured?<br /><br />Also, the peg value is crucial to how this system will operate. Consider different peg values.<br /><br />Say you peg at 1pNXT for 10NXT (so 1billion NXT worth of pNXT). In this case, the pNXT will operate in a similar way to the mgwBTC token. There will never be any scarcity of pNXT, and the gateway will be responsible for the fixed price of the pNXT gateway.<br /><br />Now say you sell all the pNXT for 1million NXT and the peg is set at 1pNXT per 0.01NXT. Now, how do you privateSend large amounts of NXT if the total value of pNXT is only 1million NXT? Now there is huge scarcity and the value of the token will likely go up. (A lower bound of the value of pNXT is set, but will pNXT holders sell it for that much when there is scarcity and demand. Plus a higher value is needed by those needing to send large amounts.) pNXT holders could hold their pNXT for speculative purposes creating more scarcity. The system is now decentralized, but may not be operating in a healthy way. (There might be large spread on the buy/sell margins for instance)<br /><br />If the pNXT is sold for 10millionNXT, then perhaps it will operate at the gateway ratio initially. But there could come a point in the future where the privacySend feature becomes more heavily used, and speculative pressures could force pNXT into a scarcity situation once again.<br /><br />After having thought this all through, I'm thinking you should go back to your original plan and just hold all the pNXT tokens in the gateway account (making sure it is secured) and set the peg at 1:1 (or even make the pNXT tokens more valuable to ensure that the scarcity situation never happens). Incentivize privacy servers to hold and trade pNXT to encourage decentralization.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/nxtservices-releases/how-to-test-multigateway-with-nxtservices-a-test-user-guide/msg63898/#msg63898">Quote from: jl777 on July 12, 2014, 09:27:19 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">it is proof of work after all the coins have been mined, so acts as proof of stake.

Design the economic incentives correctly for the privateServers, then the pNXT will be sold. (Similarly, community funds may not be needed if incentives are done correctly.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>OK, now that the torture is finished I can address some questions.<br /><br />First, let us simply explore totally removing any fund raising and see how privatesend would work:<br />1. I send NXT to a privacyServer with instructions to deliver to your acct<br />2. the privacyServer sees the NXT arrive and looks up the pNXT address of your privacyServer<br />3. my privacyServer obtains enough pNXT to satisfy the transfer. So even if it has 0 pNXT to start with, it purchases the pNXT using the NXT that it was sent<br />4. It sends the pNXT to the your privacyServer and your privacyServer now has the pNXT<br />5. Let us say we ignore timing analysis (people correlating privateSend and people receiving NXT from privacyServer) and also the worst case that your privacyServer has no NXT. It sells the pNXT for NXT and then it completes the transaction<br /><br />I am ignoring privacy info leak here so we can focus on the economic issues.<br /><br />In the above scenario, it seems that as long as there is a market for pNXT, it would work and the actual exchange rate wont matter, though liquidity and spread certainly do matter. So having a private party provide a guaranteed zero spread is a practical, though non-decentralized solution.<br /><br />If we can figure out how to ensure the market would peg the price of pNXT to NXT I think this could work. So to ensure pNXT has value, we need to have a reserve of NXT to match it. 1 million NXT is on the low side, but still with high velocity of pNXT, and a bit of patience on the parties transaction and it would suffice for most uses, though 10 million NXT seems a much better float of pNXT<br /><br />The problem of me selling the pNXT is that I would then have all the NXT, so what if I purchased all the pNXT? people cant very well complain I own 100% of what I paid 100% for. Well, ok, people will always complain, but this is just a what if. In this scenario there is 1 million (cant afford 10) NXT on one side and 1 million worth of pNXT (the exchange rate gets pegged to .01). The pNXT network (which if it had enough nodes would be as strong as any other currency with like amount of nodes) would have built in automatic gateways for pNXT &lt;-&gt; NXT<br /><br />In this scenario, the pNXTd is hardcoded to do the pNXT &lt;-&gt; NXT gateway function so while it does require trust that this does not change in future releases, people can look at the source code to verify that this function will happen.<br /><br />Of course, this scenario is flawed in that I presumably control all the servers, so we change it to a model where other people run all the servers and I seed each one with enough pNXTd to allow for smooth operations. The pNXTd nodes can self-balance the NXT and pNXT balances to adapt to usage. This is why I lean toward my subsidizing the initial sale of pNXTd.<br /><br />The one tech issue I cant solve yet is the safe managing of the NXT. I can enforce whatever behavior in pNXT as I can make changes to the core, but with NXT I am not able to do this, so until Phasing is here I doubt this would be possible to have a fully decentralized pNXT. With Phasing, the various pNXTd nodes can be required to signoff on any NXT transactions, so in essence all the NXT becomes community NXT, along with the pNXT.<br /><br />James

I think I have a good understanding of how you intend this to work. Effectively, there'll be a pNXT&lt;&gt;NXT gateway. After you sell off all the pNXT, then this gateway will be 100% NXT. This gateway will always enforce the peg (whatever it gets set to). The pNXT to NXT conversions won't have to rely 100% on this gateway because once the system is up and running, the privacyServers can trade smaller amounts (safe in the knowledge that the peg is always in place.)<br /><br />I'm unsure about the sell 100% plan. The centralization issue is still there. If you sell all the pNXT for 10million NXT and hold 100% reserves, there's still 10million NXT in one place publicly securing the pNXT tokens. For the MGW, you have 3 servers that need to agree and each bitcoin deposit account doesn't have that much in it, and the system will shut down when it detects something out of the normal. How is the NXT/pNXT gateway secured?<br /><br />Also, the peg value is crucial to how this system will operate. Consider different peg values.<br /><br />Say you peg at 1pNXT for 10NXT (so 1billion NXT worth of pNXT). In this case, the pNXT will operate in a similar way to the mgwBTC token. There will never be any scarcity of pNXT, and the gateway will be responsible for the fixed price of the pNXT gateway.<br /><br />Now say you sell all the pNXT for 1million NXT and the peg is set at 1pNXT per 0.01NXT. Now, how do you privateSend large amounts of NXT if the total value of pNXT is only 1million NXT? Now there is huge scarcity and the value of the token will likely go up. (A lower bound of the value of pNXT is set, but will pNXT holders sell it for that much when there is scarcity and demand. Plus a higher value is needed by those needing to send large amounts.) pNXT holders could hold their pNXT for speculative purposes creating more scarcity. The system is now decentralized, but may not be operating in a healthy way. (There might be large spread on the buy/sell margins for instance)<br /><br />If the pNXT is sold for 10millionNXT, then perhaps it will operate at the gateway ratio initially.

					I tried to add order matching, but I got hit with writer's block. That usually means I am not ready and sure enough I finally realized that I needed to get NXTsync functionality ported into pNXT. Without that, then everything has to go through the blockchain and while that is possible, not really so efficient.<br /><br />So, after spending yesterday fiddling with the HTML forms and making them pretty much work (all sorts of error cases dealing with server is there, server is not there, client is there, client is not there).<br /><br />I have tested these API calls:<br />select my privacyServer <br />send encrypted message to NXT address <br />check for encrypted messages from NXT address (blank for any message)<br />get all orderbooks <br />get orderbook <br />place bid <br />place ask<br /><br />dont get excited yet, the following are all still just stubs, but gives a taste of what is to come (soon!):<br /><br />privatesend NXT (NXT -&gt; pNXT -&gt; dest privacyServer -&gt; dest NXT addr)&nbsp; <br />convert pNXT cryptonotes into NXT <br />convert NXT into pNXT cryptonotes <br />send to another pNXT cryptonote address (low level pNXT to pNXT) <br />buy mgwBTC below maximum price and send to BTC address <br />sell mgwBTC above minimum price and send to NXT address <br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot. I made it so that the acctsecret needs to be passed in via API each time as pNXT wont store it internally, with just a couple of exceptions. One is due to the fact that one process is getting the API call, while another is contacting the server. The acctsecret is NOT passed to the server, but it is needed to tokenize the requests. This is how the server validates the remote API calls. so, almost all API calls have a local and remote mode. The exceptions are &quot;select&quot; and &quot;checkmessages&quot;, which by their nature are local API.<br /><br />I am currently coding and debugging one hub and a couple of spokes. So, yes it is centralized, but really each pNXTd would form its own island of centralization even as it is. Of course, once I get the basics working, I need to decentralize it and it shouldnt be too hard as I just need to get all the hubs to share the public data. Yes, easier said than done, but nothing fundamentally hard, just a matter of sending the right bytes to the right IP addresses. Now that I can internally send messages to NXT addresses, things are all set up for the peer to peer order matching.<br /><br />the following is one test sequence:<br />A: select privacyServer, responds<br />[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;NXT&quot;:&quot;17946328911576397249&quot;,&quot;pubkey&quot;:&quot;5094567f328b679aeb8b29e2ea8d30c1d92c217625f9dd88835d371c5e7ef771&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:1405231034},{&quot;token&quot;:&quot;2fkkk4qupg6r64nraedusaneps87fv6ttd4e619458iia6s860qnklp75a6u5s817q2qqv0qajnunf2ch7171uu73alalkkdthmjfhm55qd04s7dcjsbv1mfsuhsvpi7k9p71186j77fqc0gbqghlbk7g9tp5n6e&quot;}]<br /><br />notice is it sending a pubkey, that is generated each time you start the client side code (server side for that matter) and this is in a tokenized JSON.<br /><br />After this the client and server are in contact and all the commands affect the &quot;global&quot; state:<br />place bid for 5527630 (NXT) and 1639299849328439538 (BTC)<br />{&quot;obookid&quot;:&quot;1639299849331861692&quot;} the orderbookid is XOR of the two assets<br /><br />get all orderbooks<br />{ &quot;numbooks&quot;: 1, &quot;maxbooks&quot;: 1, &quot;orderbooks&quot;: [{ &quot;orderbookid&quot;: &quot;1639299849331861692&quot;, &quot;assetA&quot;: &quot;5527630&quot;, &quot;assetB&quot;: &quot;1639299849328439538&quot;, &quot;numorders&quot;: 0, &quot;maxorders&quot;: 0 }] }<br /><br />place bid for 10000 NXT at .00008 BTC<br />{&quot;txid&quot;:&quot;9564134401973145581&quot;}<br /><br />get all orderbooks<br />{ &quot;numbooks&quot;: 1, &quot;maxbooks&quot;: 1, &quot;orderbooks&quot;: [{ &quot;orderbookid&quot;: &quot;1639299849331861692&quot;, &quot;assetA&quot;: &quot;5527630&quot;, &quot;assetB&quot;: &quot;1639299849328439538&quot;, &quot;numorders&quot;: 1, &quot;maxorders&quot;: 1 }] }<br /><br />notice it now has numorders of 1<br /><br />get orderbook<br />{ &quot;orderbook&quot;: &quot;1639299849331861692&quot;, &quot;assetA&quot;: &quot;5527630&quot;, &quot;assetB&quot;: &quot;1639299849328439538&quot;, &quot;polarity&quot;: 1, &quot;bids&quot;: [[&quot;0.00008000000&quot;, &quot;10000.00000000&quot;]], &quot;asks&quot;: [] }<br /><br />send encrypted messages (to myself)<br />{&quot;status&quot;:&quot;8989816935121514892 encrypted.1108142b3212f830 sendmessage.(firstmessage) to 8989816935121514892 pending&quot;}<br />{&quot;status&quot;:&quot;8989816935121514892 encrypted.1108142b3212f830 sendmessage.(secondmessage) to 8989816935121514892 pending&quot;}<br /><br />checkmessages (any):<br />{ &quot;messages&quot;: [&quot;{\&quot;requestType\&quot;:\&quot;sendmessage\&quot;,\&quot;NXT\&quot;:\&quot;8989816935121514892\&quot;,\&quot;dest\&quot;:\&quot;8989816935121514892\&quot;,\&quot;msg\&quot;:\&quot;secondmessage\&quot;}&quot;, &quot;{\&quot;requestType\&quot;:\&quot;sendmessage\&quot;,\&quot;NXT\&quot;:\&quot;8989816935121514892\&quot;,\&quot;dest\&quot;:\&quot;8989816935121514892\&quot;,\&quot;msg\&quot;:\&quot;thirdmessage\&quot;}&quot;] }<br /><br />checkmessages from 8989816935121514892:<br />{ &quot;messages&quot;: [&quot;secondmessage&quot;, &quot;thirdmessage&quot;] }<br /><br />Well, it seems to be mangling the message and also dropping the first message, so still a couple bugs, but I finally got the cranky encryption code to work. Currently the sendmessage is via TCP to the privacyServer and then UDP from there to the destination. The UDP path is encrypted. I will add encryption to the TCP path and then all comms will be fully encrypted.<br /><br />Now GUI guys can make a nice chat interface and show all chats or just chats from specific NXT addresses<br /><br />James

The key is to match the value of NXT used to purchase all of pNXT to the value of pNXT. So if 1 million NXT comes in, then each pNXT is worth .01 NXT. If 10 million NXT comes in, each pNXT is worth 0.1 NXT. Reality is likely to be something in between. <br /><br />This conversion rate is a fixed thing. Once it is done, it is done. After that we have NXT &lt;-&gt; pNXT price locked and that will be hardcoded into pNXTd. This is really just a mechanism to ensure that each pNXT has specific value.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As I understand it, privateNXT will be used initially to help with the fundraising, but then won't be part of the system thereafter. Is that correct?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Correct. I have decided to totally forget about monetizing and solved the lack of comment issue by a different means. So the only purpose of privateNXT is to serve as the &quot;burn&quot; address to send NXT to. Of course, after the sale is done, everyone that got their privateNXT will get their pNXT and this will convert to NXT, so not really burned, but just locked for a time.<br /><br />To incentivize people to purchase privateNXT, I will be subsidizing the price. There will be some offered at .9 NXT, some at .91, etc. So there will be a small amount of profit that people can make by purchasing at the discounted price. I will make up the price difference so that there will always be 100% NXT reserve for the pNXT.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe have a requirement for privacyServers to have a certain amount of pNXT in the same way that DRK does with masternodes?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Maybe, but to encourage nodes, I am thinking of offering some pNXT for everyone that runs a node. Since more nodes is good, I think this is good use for a bit of community funds, but not sure if Damelon would agree. Due to conflict of interest, it would need to come from his half<br /><br />James

The ability to solve problems and how many lines of code a developer can write is not related, anyone can write 1000 lines of bad code.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Did I say 1000 lines of bad code?<br />If so, change it to 1000 lines of decent code.<br />Few seem to be able to achieve this. I am one of these and certainly being able to reduce the lines of code is a very important skill. I do that too. Being able to bugs is critical. I do that too.<br /><br />so, my benchmark of 1000 lines of code per day is simply a stamina criteria. Would you want a football player that could not run 5 kilometers? While many who can run 5 kilometers cant play football at all, I would be surprised if there were any really top caliber football players that were unable to run a decent 5 kilometers.<br /><br />If anything, it is a matter of typing speed. But really more a proof of fluency and ability to directly recall algorithms needed to solve the typical day's workload, without having to spend hours and hours researching.<br /><br />So, it is a basic competence test, but not for the junior position. For the junior position I understand if you are not able to do this.<br /><br />There is fixing the dividend calculation code and being able to add new coins to MGW that seem to be good junior level tasks.<br /><br />James
