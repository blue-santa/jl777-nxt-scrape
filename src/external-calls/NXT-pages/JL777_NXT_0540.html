					Thanks to nexern! He recommended both nanomsg and sophia and they are pure C projects that I feel right at home in. <br /><br />I am especially liking Sophia <a href="http://sphia.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://sphia.org/</a>:<br /><br />&quot;Sophia is a modern embeddable key-value database.<br /><br />It has unique architecture that was created as a result of research and reconsideration primary algorithmic constraints of Log-file based data structures, such as LSM-tree. (see architecture)<br /><br />Sophia is designed for fast write (append-only) and read (range query-optimized, adaptive architecture) small to medium-sized key-values.<br /><br />Sophia is feature-rich (see features).<br />BSD licensed and implemented as small C-written library with zero dependencies.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sophia database and its architecture was born as a result of research and reconsideration of primary alghorithmic constraints that relate to growing popular Log-file based data structures, such as LSM-tree, B-tree, etc.<br /><br />Most Log-based databases tend to organize own file storage as a collection of sorted files which are periodically merged. Thus, without applying some key filtering scheme (like Bloom-filter) in order to find a single key, database has to traverse all files that can take up to O(files_count * log(file_key_count)) in the worst case, and it&#039;s getting even worse for range scans, because Bloom-filter is incapable to operate with key order.<br /><br />Sophia was designed to improve this situation by providing faster read while still getting benefit from append-only design.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;Sophia defines a small set of basic operations which can be applied to any database object. Configuration, Control, Transactions and other objects are accessible using the same methods. Methods are called depending on used objects. Methods semantic may slightly change depending on used object.&quot;<br /><br />The API to Sophia is very similar to a JSON API, so mapping it to JSON API only has to deal with the issue of pointers. For now I will limit it to built in plugin mode as then pointers can actually be used. To allow usage by other processes (and nodes) I will need to add a layer that maintains the various pointers and objects for a caller, but this is a tangent so no time for it now. maybe somebody else would want to do this?<br /><br />&quot;All methods are thread-safe and atomic.&quot;<br /><br />That simple statement has a LOT of implications, all of them good.<br /><br />&quot;It is possible to use compression for a specified databases using db.database_name.compression.<br />Supported compression values: lz4, zstd, none (default).&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sophia supports single-statement and multi-statement transactions.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There are no limit on a number of concurrent transactions. Any number of databases can be involved in a multi-statement transaction.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Snapshots represent Point-in-Time read-only database view.<br /><br />It is possible to do sp_get(3) or sp_cursor(3) on snapshot object. To create a snapshot, new snapshot name should be set to snapshot control namespace.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sophia supports asynchronous Hot/Online Backups.<br /><br />Each backup iteration creates exact copy of environment, then assigns backup sequential number.<br />...<br />&nbsp;Procedure call is fast and does not block.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is possible to start incremental asynchronous checkpointing process, which will force branch creation and memory freeing for every node in-memory index. Once a memory index log is free, files also will be automatically garbage-collected.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Database monitoring is possible by getting current dynamic statistics via sp_ctl(3) object.<br /><br />Also it is possible to get current memory usage or trace every worker thread (scheduler namespace). Database indexes have total number of keys and transactional duplicates (MVCC). Total number of nodes is node_count. Branches distribution can be obtained via branch_count, branch_avg, branch_max, histogram_branch&quot;<br /><br />From what I can tell sophia has all the features of BDB, just without the bloat. maybe there are some advanced things in BDB like setting up as a synchronized cluster, but I couldnt figure out how to do that quickly. With sophia, it has compact API and best of all nice C code so I can always debug it if there are any bugs (I doubt there will be any meaningful bugs)<br /><br />To build it you probably wont believe this, but it creates a single source file that includes all the other files! Where have I seen that before?<br /><br /><a href="http://sphia.org/v12.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://sphia.org/v12.html</a><br /><br /><img src="http://sphia.org/v12.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />I dont know about you, but I usually dont get enthusiastic over a key/value store system. With sophia, well, if it does what it says it does, it will be able to be used for pretty much all the DB needs I can foresee for the medium term<br /><br />James<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

This means that an external exchange will have to adapt its code to support this behavior. Compare the MS exchange booth to the Asset Exchange page. I&#039;m not sure how much effort it will take for an exchange to implement this type of trade. Probably a lot.<br />jl, do you have a workaround for this ?<br /><br />See also the official documentation <a href="https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issue/205" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issue/205</a>:<br />&quot;EXCHANGEABLE - the currency can be exchanged with NXT. Holders of the currency can publish an exchange offer specifying the buy and sell rate of the currency much the same as banks or currency exchanges publish their exchange rates . Each account can publish only a single exchange offer at any given time. Exchange offers has an expiry block after which they are no longer in effect. Buyers and sellers can issue exchange requests to match published exchange offers. Unlike asset bid/ask orders, exchange requests are not saved, they are either executed immediately (fully or partially) or not executed at all. A match of exchange offer with a buy or sell exchange request creates an exchange entity which represents the transfer of currency units in return to NXT balance and causes the relevant account balances to update. Issuing an exchange offer reduces the NXT and currency balance of the offering account temporarily until the offer expires. Exchange offers also specifies a limit on the number of exchanged units which can be larger than the number of units offered. When a buy exchange request matches an exchange offer the number of units offered for sell is reduced and the number of units offered for buy is increased as long as the limit has not been reached. Once the exchange limit of an exchange offer has been reached, This exchange offer can no longer be used.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It is irrelevant how MS coins are traded NXT. Exchanges are not using the coin natively. when you send in a deposit, they credit your account, much like MGW does but this is not a NXT asset, it would be an exchange specific database entry<br /><br />this is how exchanges let you trade 8 decimals for assets that only have 0 decimals<br /><br />they are NOT using the native trading capability, so as long as transferCurrency works I think that is all that is needed for exchange support.<br /><br />James

This is only for a single outstanding command, eg. make request and wait for it. The way things are structured, I can handle N in parallel with little extra overhead.

We're currently waiting for:<br />1- ver 1.5 of NXT to be released which will include phasing, which we'll use for community fund accounts <br />2- the return of Darkhorse, our original community, who hasn't been active for a while . <br /><br />Well known forum member 'Pilot' has volunteered to be a community treasurer in the event that DH doesn't come back to us, so we WILL be able to reconsruct everything regarding the MIC redemption from DH's various community fund accounts. Some people sent in their MIC and ORA assets in preparation for conversion into the 'XOR' MS currency, but many didn't. <br /><br />Once NXT ver 1.5 is on mainnet we will create a new multi-user controlled phased community treasurers account, which we'll use to create the ORA MS currency (maybe not named 'XOR' now, as Darkhorse has complete control of that account) and then we'll reconstruct redemption balances that were sent in prior to the original deadline, then we'll proceed with the remaining redemptions for those who didn't send in their MIC &amp; ORA assets before.<br /><br />I'm still hopeful that DH will re-appear. He was/is a good community guy, and his part of the world did suffer some major flooding earlier this year, and that may have made it hard for him to pursue his crypto interests in recent months. His ORA accounts have been idle, so it appears he's not active, but we're still hopeful he'll be back, but if he isn't, we can still proceed.<br /><br />The other day forum member 'Jack Needles' suggested a possible use case for ORA MS currency as the 'go-to' coin to anonymize NXT accounts via 'shuffling'. I think this is an excellent idea to pursue further, as basic fungibility of crypto currencies is in serious doubt without the ability of ALL users to periodically anonymize their coins when they wish. ORA will be (probably) the MS coin with the widest distribution (and we still have coins to distribute too!), so Jack Needles suggestion is try and position ORA MS as the NXT communities defacto 'shuffle coin' is definiely worth debating &amp; exploring further! Thanks Jack <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />As always, ORA loves feedback, input, advice, suggestions, criticism - engagement!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I like this idea of a default shuffle coin!<br />It will require payments on a regular basis for the tx<br />However, I think what would be most effective is to have a single block every so often where all the shuffling happens<br /><br />No matter how good the shuffling if the total anon set it 2, then it has little privacy.<br />But if ALL ORA users at block N*1000 did the shuffle, then it will do a few things<br />a) totally fill up some NXT blocks<br />b) randomize which tx end up in these full blocks<br />c) create a pretty large anon set, which will allow others to more safely mix their tx during this specified block<br />d) create regular (weekly?) events that are at least noticeable<br /><br />However, ORA will need to have a meaningful market value for it to be useful for doing anything real.<br /><br />The total value should be &gt; than the total tx volume of these shuffling blocks. I have an idea for this.<br /><br />Also, I think someone can make a shuffle party plugin so you can set it to be active and it shows some cool countdown sequence, or just memes to tie it into its MIC history<br /><br />James

					finally got the internal process plugin working. just with an echo plugin, but I wanted to verify the overhead is low enough to use for all the major functionality of SuperNET.<br /><br />So I fiddled with the plugins for a full day as I never want to have to revisit this, I just want to make plugins, theoretically they will be much faster to add, more robust and best of all will allow others to add SuperNET API in any of a dozen languages.<br /><br />I used the IPC, interprocess transport and it took about half a millisecond per roundtrip call. I also didnt have a mechanism to get the return data back to the caller. Now that is ~2000 requests per second and since it doesnt use any tcp sockets for each new comm, it is already several times faster than bitcoin RPC. But at that speed, many plugins wont be responsive enough.<br /><br />The in process plugins benchmarked at 60 microseconds per round trip, which is over 15,000 requests per second, but that was with unoptimized (by compiler) code. The optimized code is exposing some timing bugs, probably cuz it goes too fast.<br /><br />debugging that as I port a very nice database <a href="http://sphia.org/architecture.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://sphia.org/architecture.html</a> into a plugin. It took literally 5 minutes to get a plugin made, but I still need to map all the sophia API to the plugin API. What this means is that the full sophia API will extend the SuperNET API as it will be an internal plugin. So ramchains and MGW can use it as the data store, sophia is designed to use &quot;log files&quot; as its database, so it is perfect for blockchains. Still need to validate all the potential coolness of sophia, but the BDB was just took klunky and had the habit of 100% infinite loops on startup if anything was wrong with any of the files. Hopefully sophia will be much more tolerant of such things<br /><br />Short term:<br />1. debug optimized code and benchmark internal plugin overhead<br />2. port sophia into plugin and make C callable wrapper<br />3. use sophia API for ramchains and MGW<br />4. make networking plugin for MGW comms (wont be hard at all)<br />5. use networking plugin for MGW comms.<br />6. release brand new shiny MGW plugin<br />7. make InstantDEX plugin<br />8. make plugins out of everything else<br />9. hope other devs can make the plugin adaptor for the dozen other languages<br /><br />James

They used to exist<br /><br />jl777 [11:01 PM]<br />In fact they used to be pretty big services<br /><br />jl777 [11:01 PM]<br />of course google uses the ad supported model,but my point is that zero cost has some very powerful effects<br /><br />jl777 [11:02 PM]<br />what decentralized crypto assets have is a zero cost (to the asset) infrastructure<br /><br />jl777 [11:02 PM]<br />the decentralization is applied to the backend server infrastructure, so it doesnt violate any &quot;natural laws&quot;<br /><br />jl777 [11:03 PM]<br />as PC become more powerful than 100 servers used to be, just a few dozen users allocating a fraction of their computer resources is more than a dedicated server operation used to be<br /><br />jl777 [11:03 PM]<br />of course the software needs to be efficient to take full advantage of this, or need to wait a few more years<br /><br />jl777 [11:04 PM]<br />I choose the former to make the software as lightweight as possible<br /><br />jl777 [11:05 PM]<br />and of course by making the assets monetized, we can obtain monetary valuations, but instead of PE using time horizons of 10 years or 20 years, it can be over longer periods<br /><br />jl777 [11:05 PM]<br />assuming the devs involved can be relied on not to be obsoleted<br /><br />jl777 [11:05 PM]<br />so that is why the market puts a lot of value on the cutting edge devs, they intuitively know that tech does get obsoleted, so to invest in the devs that are doing the obsoleting of other tech is the safest bet
