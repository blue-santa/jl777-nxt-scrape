					Point of clarification.<br /><br />I have already described the usages for the BTC raised, but I have not clarified the usage for the NXT and BTCD.<br />Most likely they will be simply long term HODL as they are staking/forging for their communities.<br /><br />However, for the NXT as there are quite a few NXT based companies now issuing promising assets. I would like to use the NXT raised as the capital for NXTventure to use for making investments at seed to offering stages. NXTventure has done quite well with assets that I have made and limited success with third party originated assets, so the past performance cannot be expected. Of course, I will do my best to make good solid investments that have the best chances for good returns. <br /><br />I have been making market rate swaps between my personal acct and the main assets to maximize the revenue sharing that will be going to SuperNET from them. I also am working with large holders of assets so that we can get close to the 50% mark for the key assets. During this process, I had to swap my personal 30% ownership of NXTventure into InstantDEX. And if all goes well, about half of instantDEX will go into the core. So that is a 15% beneficial ownership of NXTventure and I will be able to add another 25% or so. This means that SuperNET will be getting 40% of NXTventure dividends, so I think this justifies letting NXTventure have access to the SuperNET funds for its investments. Now, the NXTventure will need to pay back the capital it is using when the investment is offered to the public sale of assets. After this amount is paid back, then there will be the remaining assets that NXTventure has. For those not familiar with NXTventure, it is like a seed investor that goes from that point all the way to selling the assets, so not that it is exact, but something similar to a VC/investment bank, but operating on crypto time.<br /><br />What this means is that SuperNET will be getting dividends in the form of the assets that it has incubated. So, for everyone with a good crypto business plan, there is this method of achieving a publicly traded asset and of course the entire SuperNET cross marketing. So this is a quite good plan and I feel better now, as it was not sitting right that arguably one of the most powerful of my assets was on the sidelines for the SuperNET.<br /><br />I thank the poster who asked me about NXTventure as regards to SuperNET. I dont really think of NXTventure like an operating asset as there is no software it is making, but certainly the hybrid nature of SuperNET is a perfect home for NXTventure and now it will have a decent sized amount to invest.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. even though coinomat is not one of my assets, I have been a strong supporter and have a significant percentage of its assets. Due to its key part in the fiat interfacing I believe it belongs in the SuperNET core.

It's true you need not only buy milk or table but if it's very needed, you can sell your currency for NXT for exemple.<br /><br />For exemple, I need 200 bottles of milk per year. I can buy the currency of the farmer (or a community of farmers) at the beginning of the year. They can buy some at the beginning of the year because they sell Farmercoin as :<br />- 100 coin buy -&gt; 1 offer<br />- 1000 coin buy -&gt; 15 offer<br /><br />I buy it with NXT or other currency, etc. I can buy it with my &quot;DevelopperCoin&quot; (if I'm in a federation of freelance developers) or &quot;Googlecoin&quot; (if I'm a employe of Google). Or I can sell my DevelopperCoin to NXT and NXT to FarmerCoin. It can be automatised and very quick.<br /><br />With this coins, I can buy milk, eggs, potatoes, etc. It as a very stable value.<br /><br />Ok, the example shouldn't be between alone people but it could be make with bigger groups : 100k persons in a group, it's a lot I think.<br /><br />Nxt makes possible what was not before : the problem of change is not any more au problem.<br /><br />Edit : I have an Idea for a Scify Novel (Writer is a part of my job) that explain how could be a decentralised world with such of different currencies.

OK, follow the money what are the ongoing fees for the &quot;ETF&quot; portion of SuperNET. 0%<br />what is the total load factor for the purchase of NAV: 1% of funds raised, onetime<br /><br />Now no ETF I ever heard of is operating as a software company that is creating its own user base and monetizing it, but for completeness let us ask what the overhead costs are for this portion: 10%, meaning it is run at a 90% profit margin<br /><br />What is my giant salary and cost for office space: 0.00000000 per year, but I do get a nice holiday bonus of 0.00000000<br /><br />Why am I doing this if I dont make money. Well I will be putting in most of my $2 mil networth into it and I do like to take care of how my investments are doing.<br /><br />There is also a bit of a thing that is not related to money that is motivating me.<br /><br />James

However, if the money is coming in, I would have a fiduciary duty to do my best effort and now that people know what I am able to do, I might have to do the whole M&amp;A thing <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br />
