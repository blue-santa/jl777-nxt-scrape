Who will have full access to the investments? What safeguards are you putting in place?<br />If you drop dead from exhaustion (I somewhat expect it to happen one of these days, we should start a betting pool <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> ), then what?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am planning on using places like BTER that have separate login and withdraw passwords. So, both voldemort and I will be able to trade, but only I will be able to withdraw funds from the trading account. We will probably just compound it in the account anyway, so probably not a big issue.<br /><br />Ive been working at this pace for quite a few years, no need to worry about that. My secret is that I sleep until I wake up! No alarm clocks, so my body fully recharges for another &quot;day&quot;. I am on a 28 hour &quot;day&quot; cycle as that is the duration of a day on my home planet<br /><br />I have made backups of all the passwords and if I do get hit by a bus (I dont go outside very often), well my wife will be very sad, but she will do what she has to so that all investor funds are accessible. I am thinking about setting up some sort of way to send my passwords upon my demise to with instructions on setting up a permanent foundation for the NXT community from my personal assets. Estate planning is a bit early though, so give me a bit of time on that one<br /><br />James

					voldemort628 and I will be jointly managing the NXTsharks funds<br /><br />sharkfund0 has been created to obtain crypto funds to be managed. We dont expect to start trading the fund until July. No specific timeframe on when we will release NXTsharks assets to the AE, probably around the time we start trading the sharkfund0, of course nice bids on AE might change our mind <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I will be putting a chunk of my personal funds into sharkfund0, so if you want to piggy back on the same trades that I do, all you need to do is get some sharkfund0. I cant promise any specific level of return, but I can say that I have done pretty well with my personal crypto investments so far. Buying 1%+ of DRK and burning half percent of XCP, not to mention my NXT has been the bulk of the gains though, so it might be that I just got lucky.<br /><br />James

It can be a coding project, or financing, or marketing, etc.<br /><br />However, it is very clear to me that there are far more than this number of tasks that need to be done. Fortunately, the best talents in the NXT community are coming to me to help out with all my enterprises. While there will not be any formal corporate structure, I think it helps if people knew who has what responsibilities within my organization.<br /><br />NXT is global so it does not make sense to adopt any single country's set of laws of corporate governance, especially since we are not exactly a corporation. So, I will use my own common sense rules and do the right thing to make sure that everybody that is associated with any of the assets, products, services, etc. is treated the way that I would want to be treated if the positions were reversed. I think that is a good way to run things and I hope you agree.<br /><br />integrity, honour and wisdom<br /><br />If you have executive level experience and would like to join the largest NXT based organization and arguably one of the fastest growing in the entire crypto space, all you have to do is PM me and explain how you can help out. If I agree, I am apt to encapsulate your talents and issue another asset and make more work for voldemort <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />So while I can only do about ten things at once I can manage and coordinate hundreds of people, been there, done that. I guess this is the &quot;official&quot; announcement of jl777 enterprises, a global conglomerate of NXT oriented profit making assets. There is no direct way to invest. You can earn equity by joining the team, if you do your homework, you will easily find a way to get a very close proxy to jl777 enterprises.<br /><br />James<br /><br />Here is the current &quot;structure&quot;<br /><br />cointropolis+justabit Sales/real world meetings<br />uniquorn marketing<br />voldemort628 finance<br />jl777 *<br /><br />

					I cannot answer that question, but I get so many PMs with that same question, I decided to solve this matter.<br />I made jl777hodl asset. when possible, it will simply hodl ~10% of the assets that I create. I cant guarantee every asset will make it into this account, but once it does, it will be there to stay for the long term. Any changes would be done at market value trades, so the amount of hodlings could change, but only when I feel a trade makes sense. I dont promise to actively trade the account for gains, just need to have the option to do so. I intend to just transfer the assets in and forget about it.<br /><br />If you cannot decide which of my assets to get, this asset offers a way to get a piece of many at the same time<br /><br />You can check the account hodlings just by looking at: NXT-2AHU-UXZW-K9Q2-HENLW<br /><br />James

The 1% to 2% seems right in line with what I was thinking of, it will allow depositors to get double the forging rate and borrowers to get very low interest loans<br /><br />This will be a low profitability enterprise, I think it should be a community asset (like MGW), so if you commit to being mr bankerman, I will issue NXTbank asset, both of us would get 10%, we offer the rest at near 0, just enough to raise funds to pay you a bounty upon completion.<br /><br />So the asset serves as a way to raise the bounty for you and instead of just getting a warm fuzzy feeling, the donors have an asset that in the long run might actually get them their donation back.<br /><br />What do you thing?

These are letters used to enable a seller to ship goods because a 3rd party has promised that the buyer can pay and is guaranteeing payment...<br /><br />This is an expensive and slow process at the moment and this company is looking at how something like NXT might be able to help improve this process.<br /><br />Basically as I understand it this is escrowed funds for international delivery of goods, may not need to do the funds escrow but assist the management of the letter of credit token to automate the release of the funds on delivery between the buyer and the seller.<br /><br />Tbh this one had me stumped a bit and still does - any ideas?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So we have Seller that gets a letter of credit from guarantor and the buyer who probably secured the payment with guarantor.<br /><br />The seller waits until guarantor attests that if they make shipment, they are guaranteed to get payment<br />Now probably the buyer will need to approve the proper receipt of the shipment at a location where it does not control the shipment.<br />Then if they reject the shipment, buyer doesnt get delivery, everyone is cranky but no money changes hands<br />If the buyer accepts, they indicate this to the guarantor somehow and they are able to take delivery and the seller gets payment<br /><br />If I got that right, are they trying to eliminate the guarantor?<br />We would still need a place where the buyer can inspect the shipment and approve or disapprove the shipment. I guess that is more of a warehousing thing, so bankers arent involved and let us assume we have this.<br /><br />this might work:<br />buyer creates an AM message that says they approve the shipment, they dont broadcast<br />they also create a payment tx to seller that refers to the AM txid<br /><br />they send to seller both raw tx bytes, the first one unsigned the second one signed<br />the seller verifies the payment is acceptable and publishes an AM to that effect and broadcasts the payment tx<br />when the buyer sees the AM, they broadcast the acceptance AM<br /><br />The warehouse waits for both AMs to appear, the buyers acceptance AM and the sellers approval of payment AM<br />the warehouse needs to verify that the AM;s havent been altered and if both buyer and seller AMs are received the warehouse releases the shipment<br /><br />See, pretty simple <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />Clearly all parties will need to have all this automated and GUI'ized. NXTatomic already implements the buyer and seller portion or at least pretty close, but the warehouse part and using AM's is not there yet. If my algo is good, that means there is nothing stopping this from being done, other than my lack of time<br /><br />James<br />

Also, if the payment is based on the ownership ratio at a specific block, why do you need to know whey they got the asset?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are right in my special case paying dividends depend on when the first time that asset sold from issuer. The first time is important for me not sure that will be important for others.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is why I asked!<br />OK, so you actually need three things. You need to know the date the asset sold for the first time from your account. Do you ALWAYS sell, or sometimes transfer, eg. they send manual payment and you transfer instead of using AE.<br /><br />Do you need the above data to calculate the total dividend payout, or is it unrelated tracking of overall sales?<br />if the latter, I would like to take care of dividend calcs first<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes! I sometimes Transfer! <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" /> I forgot that!<br />No I need the data to calculate the dividends each asset holder should receive. And need the second script to pay it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are you saying you need to track the exact asset across ownership changes and allocate different amounts to each specific asset? If so, that is not possible as assets are fungible. what happens if someone buys asset on Monday and another person buys an asset on Wed, then on thursday they both transfer it to a third person, who then sends half of it to a fourth person.<br /><br />Please tell me how to allocate the Monday asset and Wed asset between the third person and fourth person.<br />This is like mixing. You cant use a fungible asset to represent nonfungible things. The Monday asset is not fungible with the Wed asset, yet the NXT assets are all exactly the same. There are no txin/txout threads to backtrace so any allocation will be a statistical allocation.<br /><br />Might I suggest an alternate approach that has a verifiable solution?<br /><br />For each dividend period calculate the total dividend you are to issue. You can do this from your sales records, yes? So we have Total_dividend. Then separately we find all the asset holders and add up how many assets are in accounts that are not the issuing acct. Now we can calculate the amount each asset should get by dividing Total_dividend by the sum of assets in the wild. From there its easy to allocate to each account.<br /><br />Now, you will notice that people who buy the asset right before the dividend date would dilute the dividends from the people who had it all week. Since everyone can do this, and it only happens the first time the asset is issued, it is hopefully an acceptable compromise. If not we are back to a statistical allocation that is a lot more difficult to implement and prone to bugs<br /><br />If it is a big problem for the edge case of late purchasers, I suggest taking the asset off the market during the last days before the dividend block

This solution helps no one (other than the owner of the pool of course), more importantly it does not help the NXT to expand.<br />The best way of action here in my opinion is to set up a bounty for a open source tool set allowing anybody to set up their own forging pool (basic functionality is the minimum). That way, even if the winner disappears, the tool is still in the hands of the community. <br /><br />All I am saying is that we should avoid the multi pool fiasco, 2 bounties were given out and after not long we did not have any. The situation got partially solved, but you get my point.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am assuming the bounty was for source code and instructions on how to setup a leasing pool.

You need to know the date the asset sold for the first time from your account. Do you ALWAYS sell, or sometimes transfer, eg. they send manual payment and you transfer instead of using AE.<br /><br />Do you need the above data to calculate the total dividend payout, or is it unrelated tracking of overall sales?<br />if the latter, I would like to take care of dividend calcs first<br /><br />James

The one who owns it on the critical date (block) gets the earnings. This is why the value of dividend producing assets drops right after the dividend is issued, typically by the dividend amount. but the world is not a totally precise place so the adjustment might not be exact<br /><br />it is possible to allocate based on time held,but thats a lot of complication and most assets that are not held by day traders are pretty stable. also, day traders typically dont care about dividends, unless they are arbitraging the exdividend payout<br /><br />anyway I am not going to do the allocation, just a list as of ex-dividend block
