I prefer the NXT approach (especially at larger scales) for the blockchain, but to each their own. Some people even like soy milk!<br /><br />By being more centralized, btsx probably gets more speed, at least until I get InstantDEX done. We can debate which is better, etc. but the numbers tell me that NXT is already a bit more decentralized than bitshares and will continue to be more so as time passes. Add in the human factor needed and bitshares is not directly comparable to NXT, but still bitshares is much closer to NXT than most other things, so let us consider each other the crazy cousin up in the attic <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I think that we can agree that regardless of which is &quot;better&quot;, either is miles ahead of Ghash.iocoin<br />I also think the human factor which is not desirable for blockchain matters is quite suitable and even preferable for assets. I assume bitshares will have assets? Would there be a way to easily make an asset gateway between the two systems so that the same asset can be on either?<br /><br />I think that would benefit both<br /><br />James

I do not actually think 1 delegate would be decentralized because stakeholders do not have reaction time less than 10 seconds, it is just to emphasize that at the end of the day it is about how directly do the 51% stakeholders control who the block producers are. What is the &quot;churn rate&quot; for bad delegates, how much redundancy do you need?&nbsp; (actually you would need 2 delegates at least if the bad one starts blocking transactions... but I think you see the point I'm making).<br /><br />The previous point I was making is that *at scale*, there will not be many distinct full validating nodes. In bitcoin there are fewer than 5k full nodes, and bitcoin processes like 2tps and has only 15gb blockchain.<br /><br />With DPOS it is economically feasible for 51% stake which is distributed among 1,000 individuals to overpower a single 10% stakeholder. This is also economically feasible in NXT with leased forging! It is only NOT economically feasible in PPC style POS where there is no stake delegation. So actually my argument is not that NXT preserves decentralization worse at scale, I am first just trying to get people to admit that all consensus systems lead to centralization and that accounting for centralized entities is required. With NXT it is an ad-hoc process where stakeholders have to monitor forging pools.<br /><br />Assuming I can get people to agree this far then the only difference between NXT and DPOS is the voting mechanism, direct vs approval voting. This is basically, &quot;how effectively can you keep bad stake from producing blocks&quot;.<br /><br />tl;dr I am not arguing that DPOS is significantly better than NXT as much as I am trying to get you guys to admit that 101 distinct block producers is not more centralized than NXT at scale.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I just realized the title of this thread is quite directly comparing the two systems. Have you checked the size of the largest forging pool? Even though it is theoretically possible that some forging pool could get to 51% of NXT, this wont happen. i think currently the largest pool has around 8% , maybe a bit more, but I think this is because one of the 5% stakeholders is using it. if any pool starts getting above 10%, I will start making noises. If it gets to 20%, I will probably sell all my NXT and encourage everybody else to. So forging wont ever get to 50%, or if it does, it wont be my concern anymore. Due to marketcap and liquidity, just buying up 50% NXT is not feasible, so I am comfortable with NXT forging process.<br /><br />relying on people to vote properly seems quite dangerous. I point to any election as my proof <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />So, DPOS using the wisdom of people voting to ensure good results within a max of 101 forging nodes, as opposed to NXT that has no need for this and also no limit to the number of forging nodes, though practically speaking at the current distribution clumpage it is around 300 nodes that are able to forge and probably the top 100 forge most of the blocks.<br /><br />Do the 100 DPOS nodes all have equal chance to make the next block? If so, at current levels (ignoring the wisdom of popular voting results), the two systems appear to be roughly the same, at least from the view of how many nodes are eligible to forge the next block.

The number of people for whom it is worth their while will decrease.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It's worth their while to forge because they have to run a node to process business transactions.<br /><br />Bitshares is intentionally capping the network at 101 forgers.&nbsp; Why would you impose a self-limitation?&nbsp; It seems like flawed thinking.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />For every increase in cost there is a decrease in number of willing forgers. At some scale there it is more expensive to run a node than the risk premium for outsourcing the job of full validation. We just have not reached that scale yet so it is not visible - heck you can even run a bitcoin full node for $40/month.<br /><br />At some bandwidth/RAM requirement level it switches from &quot;intentionally capping&quot; to &quot;intentionally decentralizing past what you need&quot;. Look at the graphs I posted above, you can only argue &quot;it will never reach a scale/cost ratio to where 101 is the sweet spot&quot; and not &quot;that trend doesn't happen&quot;.<br /><br />That said, if it turns out 101 is not the sweet spot, it could be changed. <strong>We have no reason</strong> to think it is greater than 101 and <strong>in fact I suspect it is less</strong>. Again, having a single forger would still be decentralized <strong>if you assumed very active stakeholders</strong>. <br /><br /><del>Right now BTC has effectively 2 forgers that control the network, but people still call it decentralized. Why? Because it's a social consensus and not a technological one. All you need is for a single block producer to be able to suddenly stop producing blocks and for the network to recover from it.</del><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think it would be more productive to just stick to the facts, instead of injecting subjective assessments into the evaluations. Then everyone can make up their minds on whether it is decentralized enough for them. Some people actually like things that are centralized.<br /><br />I bolded the parts I felt were commentary and not factual. Also the BTC PoW flaw are not really relevant, are they? Clearly almost anything is more decentralized than Ghash.iocoin (aka BTC)<br /><br />so just describe how many delegates (101), how many different people are they (?), etc.<br /><br />Also I dont understand how the activity of the stakeholders would allow a system with one forger to be decentralized. I am thinking maybe we have different definitions for such words?<br /><br />James

I saw some company got millions of USD in VC for making of multisig wallets. Sounds like great tech, similar to MGW, which I did for total expenditure of 100,000 NXT and food costs.<br /><br />James

They will be able to create customized private blockchains using Turing complete scripting written in C with access to all the API's I can get interfaced to.

Why would I want to buy bitcoin dark if I can just teleport bitcoins directly?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>you have it backwards<br />NXTservices inside BTCD will teleport the coins, NXTprivacy will get the teleport fees, some of it will be shared with BTCD stakers.<br /><br />I think most people think in simpler models than what I am building. Like it is hard to properly model a three dimensional object in two dimensions.<br /><br />NXTservices is my codebase that will have the functionality for Teleport, InstantDEX, Tradebots, Privatebet, etc.<br /><br />There are assets that map closely to each of these functions. BTCD is getting 10% profit share from the various different revenue streams, so it can be viewed as the hub, with each of the different assets as the spokes. I have composed current sharkfund0 portfolio to gain as Teleport gains and we have seen the effect of this (14000 -&gt; 19000 NXT in short time)<br /><br />That is the &quot;two dimensional&quot; simple view.<br />Now, the &quot;Nxt Inside&quot; campaign is getting new exposure and marketing and users for NXT. We all agree this is important, but it also really helps out any coin that integrates it as otherwise they will be far, far behind the functionality of BTCD. So I am raising the bar required for any altcoin to have a chance at top 25 status.<br /><br />I will be revenue sharing with any coin that puts Nxt Inside and becomes part of the supernetwork. I hope to be able to create a monetization plan so that all teleport fees are more than covered by the coin's revenue sharing, so in effect they will get paid to plug into the supernetwork and get free teleporting<br /><br />The larger the supernetwork, the more activity, the more privacy as unlike any other anon coin Teleport's anon set scales directly with overall activity. So the larger the supernetwork, the better. InstantDEX will have more bidders and sellers, so narrower spreads and more liquidity. Privatebet gets more bettors, NXT Marketplace and AE simply get more people aware and the universal reaction so far from former NXT-bashers (who never actually even looked at NXT) is, &quot;wow! I never knew NXT was so cool&quot;<br /><br />The biggest effect of Teleport will be to make bitcoin itself dark. With ~$100 million of BTC commerce per day, even 1% going dark via Telport will be a significant effect and with BTCD climbing the charts and teleporting BTC and including NXT inside, at some point people will realize hating NXT is pointless<br /><br />My tech has some impact on NXT value, but even now with BTCD marketcap so much smaller, whatever effect my tech has on NXT, its impact on BTCD is ten times more. Anyway, what is good for BTCD is good for NXT and the better BTCD does, the more coins will put Nxt Inside. And you might make some money along the way, even at current levels, with the scope of what I am doing, I would not be surprised for some additional gains.<br /><br />It is hard to estimate proper value for BTCD as it will have all of Nxt inside, plus some dividends from my assets. So, I doubt it can reach the marketcap of NXT as Nxt is inside, however with other factors (like dividends) it is quite possible for panic buying to get it in the same ballpark, though I am expecting a sustainable level to be around half NXT marketcap. Just not sure as I am making BTCD into something that have never existed before. A crypto that pays dividends like an asset, a crypto that anonymizes any other coin, a crypto that pays other coins to make a supernetwork.<br /><br />James<br />
