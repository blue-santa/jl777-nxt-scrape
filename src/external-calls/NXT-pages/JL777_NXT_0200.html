It's called Blind Shooter.<br />2. Base target adjustement algorithm. It doesn't have a name because it was supposed to be removed within the first year of Nxt existence, I'll be calling it BTAA for short.<br /><br />BTAA's main contract is to prevent a guy with a lot of computing power to replace last N blocks with his own blocks that have a higher &quot;weight&quot; and lead to blockchain reorganization. Unlike Bitcoin, Nxt forging &quot;power&quot; is pretty limited on the both ends. It can't be higher than 1 billion coins nor it can be lower than 100 million coins, because in the latter case the security of the blockchain is very low and such a coin can be easily attacked (so this situation won't last long anyway). Taking this into account we see that if the marketcap is not high and incentive to spend resources of a supercomputer is very low we can safely get rid of BTAA.<br /><br />Capping *min* base target at 300% was a fast fix. Now after mthcl suggested to cap *max* base target too, it seems to me it's a good moment to remove BTAA completely. Just set a constant base target at some level, say 500% (rough estimate).<br /><br />*****<br />the above is from CfB via slack<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We can as well set the basetarget to a constant level, say, 300-500%, as CfB suggests. This will stabilize the block times even more, and everything would work as a charm. For now.<br /><br />However, this would only work as long as the proportion of the active stake remains virtually unaltered (for long time it was fluctuating around 38%). Because with this solution the mean blocktime would be simply proportional to the active stake. When the Nxt conquers the world, blocks will be full of transactions, so everybody would care about forging; the proportion of active stake would be, say, 90%, and the mean blocktime would go to, say, 15 seconds. Do we need it really? More syncro issues, heavier blockchain...<br /><br />So, I would still let the basetarget fluctuate (probably, not so rapidly), but would modify the adjustment algorithm. There is a need for simulations, though, to determine the &quot;better&quot; parameters. Anybody wants to do the simulations?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>NXT is hardforking several times per year.<br />I suggest just to adjust the basetarget to match the most recent time period's staking level<br /><br />This is simple, adaptable and even if there is a massive change in forging percentage we could always hardfork to just change that if it is really a bad situation, but this seems quite unlikely.<br /><br />The big problem now with the variance in blocktimes from 3 seconds to 2 hours is that it is a BIG problem. especially for things like instantdex that need to make assumptions about the number of blocks that will occur within the deadline<br /><br />James

When this happens, transactions will compete for getting into those blocks based on their fee/size ratio, and it is not guaranteed which of your 4 transactions, if any, will make it in before the finish height. If Alice feetx gets accepted, then Bob's phased tx gets accepted, then there are several full blocks in a row and finish height is passed, and only then Alice tx gets accepted (still before its deadline), Bob's phased tx will not be executed, but Alice tx will. In the other scenario, if finish height is far into the future, and a sequence of full blocks prevents Alice tx from getting in before the deadline, Alice tx will not be accepted, but neither will Bob's tx get executed. The downside is that with finish height far into the future, Alice needs to wait until that height to receive the benefit from Bob's tx.<br /><br />Maybe both finish height and deadline should be an option that the users can control, with the UI pointing out the risks behind each choice. Then those who don't need to receive the funds from Bob fast, can opt to wait, those who prefer faster resolution of the whole process, can choose shorter finish height.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>User settable finish height is what I concluded also<br /><br />It seems we are on the same page. No totally pure solution and a tradeoff must be made, so pick reasonable defaults but allow the user to override. that seems the best that can be done.<br /><br />unless you can allow for dually signed tx...<br /><br />James

Then after the finish height, Bob's transaction will no longer be executed, but all others will still be valid and can be executed.<br /><br />What if the one that starts the whole process, in this case Alice, first needs to pay a fee to begin with, for example by posting the details about her two transactions as a prunable message?<br /><br />Or if you track uncompleted exchanges due to fault on Alice side (even if she does not submit the transactions, Bob's transaction in the blockchain will still point to her as recipient).<br /><br />About immediate execution of phased transactions before finish height, I will look into that for 1.7 if possible.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I dont know how to predict the deadline which is in minutes vs finish height which is in blocks. The large variability of blocktimes makes it impossible to make the deadline and finish height matched in all cases.<br /><br />I am setting the deadline out at 2 hours which is 2x a one hour block. This is to maximize the chance that the triggertx will confirm and there will be enough time left for the other things to happen.<br /><br />I already have offchain comms between Alice and Bob, not sure what the benefit is for having her pay a fee for a trade that might not happen.<br /><br />I havent been able to figure out how to make alicetx dependent on bobtx and bobtx dependent on alicetx, since you need the fullhash to set a phaselink and the phaselink field presumably affects the full hash. This means that only one side can have a phaselinked tx.<br /><br />Maybe I missed a way to calibrate the deadline to the finish height or to directly setup a dependency link between the two main tx between alice and bob.<br /><br />The normal behavior I am seeing is that alice and bob negotiate off chain, alice broadcasts her two tx and it appears in the next block. then bob's tx and alice's tx appear (though bob's isnt at phase height yet) and the following block bob's fee tx appears. so as long as edge cases dont happen, in 3 seconds all the trades are established and in 3 blocks they are all in the blockchain and a few blocks later the finish height completes the transaction.<br /><br />In the event a long block comes in between the triggertx and the other tx, then I think we have the worst case of alice losing her trigger tx fee. If we can get just one block after the trigger tx, then both the real tx are in the blockchain, so i dont think the deadline matters anymore (other than bob's fee tx which we can ignore for such edge cases)<br /><br />So as long as there isnt a way for the alicetx to get confirmed while bobtx doesnt, we are good. since both of those are reftx to the same trigger, unless we throw in an evil forger controlled by bob which blocks bobtx, but N blocks in a row will have to be controlled and all of them blocking bobtx, so at a finish height 7 to 10 blocks in the future, it seems quite unlikely for such manipulations to be cost effective.<br /><br />James

And that quote by Mike Hearn, about red/blacklisting coins linked to &quot;crimes&quot;, is that also being implemented?<br /><br />You know that my position has always been that no blacklisting or filtering will be allowed on the Nxt blockchain, because our goal is to provide a neutral platform. IP addresses are never stored on the blockchain, and we make sure it is not possible to tell whether a transaction received from a peer really originated from it, or was forwarded from another (unless you can monitor all traffic of that peer). And the coin shuffling in 1.7 will be a major step towards increasing privacy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><a href="http://shitco.in/2015/08/19/the-bitcoin-xt-trojan/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://shitco.in/2015/08/19/the-bitcoin-xt-trojan/</a><br />

					come-from-beyond [3:33 AM] <br />Due to a lot of misunderstandings caused by quoting of my words without the proper context I asked jl777 to re-post the following:<br /><br />Basically, forging algorithm of Nxt has 2 main parts:<br />1. &quot;Lottery&quot; algorithm that is used to pick the next forger. It's called Blind Shooter.<br />2. Base target adjustement algorithm. It doesn't have a name because it was supposed to be removed within the first year of Nxt existence, I'll be calling it BTAA for short.<br /><br />BTAA's main contract is to prevent a guy with a lot of computing power to replace last N blocks with his own blocks that have a higher &quot;weight&quot; and lead to blockchain reorganization. Unlike Bitcoin, Nxt forging &quot;power&quot; is pretty limited on the both ends. It can't be higher than 1 billion coins nor it can be lower than 100 million coins, because in the latter case the security of the blockchain is very low and such a coin can be easily attacked (so this situation won't last long anyway). Taking this into account we see that if the marketcap is not high and incentive to spend resources of a supercomputer is very low we can safely get rid of BTAA.<br /><br />Capping *min* base target at 300% was a fast fix. Now after mthcl suggested to cap *max* base target too, it seems to me it's a good moment to remove BTAA completely. Just set a constant base target at some level, say 500% (rough estimate).<br /><br />*****<br />the above is from CfB via slack

					CfB has recommendation to set MINIMUM base target to 300% (unrelated to only one third of stake is forging). This would be an easy fix to do that will dramatically reduce the chance of the super long block and also get the average blocktime much closer to one minute.<br /><br />@jean-luc: is there any reason not do make this change in the next hard fork? getting more consistent blocktimes and much closer to the advertised one minute seems quite a powerful thing.<br /><br />When EC and TF are enabled these things can always be changed, but for now getting more consistent blocktimes is quite important and it will allow InstantDEX to clear trades faster and more securely.<br /><br />James

					a cap on the longest a block can take will be very beneficial to instantdex ordermatching<br /><br />there is a formula (duration / blocktime) that limits the number of blocks in the future a phasing finish height can be. with the blocktime possibly one hour, I need to set the duration to 2 hours, which ties up funds for up to 2 hours in case it doesnt complete for whatever reason.<br /><br />Now most all the cases I am seeing completion times of about 3 seconds. at that point the trade is locked from both sides and the simple passage of time will get them all confirmed.<br /><br />So we are talking about edge cases where there is a blockchain event or an attacker, in these cases the farther ahead the finish height is, the safer.<br /><br />James

This will be the trigger tx that when confirmed should cause all the others to get confirmed, or in the worst case, it is the only one confirmed and the fee is lost.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Since neither feetx nor Alicetx is phased, it is not really Alice that gets to define finish height. But Alice should verify that the finish height (which is defined in Bob's phased tx) is expected to be after the expiration deadline of Alice tx, so that an evil forger working for Bob cannot wait until the finish height of Bob tx is reached, and only then let Alice tx be accepted in the blockchain.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Alice also creates the Alicetx that is a transfer/payment to Bob. this one uses the fullhash of the trigger tx as its reftx, but it is not phased as I want to use a streamlined one step offchain protocol.

Bob's fee tx (not phased) would use Alice tx's full hash as its reftx and broadcasts both of these into the unconfirmed txpool.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Why does Bobtx need to use reftx on Alice feetx? This would make it stay in the unconfirmed pool, until Alice broadcasts her feetx.<br />Since Bobtx is phased, even if it gets accepted into the blockchain immediately, it will only get executed if Alicetx is also accepted, and Alicetx can be accepted only if Alice feetx is accepted, therefore Bobtx's execution will still transitively depend on Alice feetx.<br />But allowing Bobtx to be accepted immediately makes it safer (for Alice) against evil forger attacks that exclude Bobtx.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Alice verifies that Bob's tx are as agreed to and broadcasts both of her tx and assuming they are confirmed, it trigger's Bob's tx and all are happy.<br /><br />Alice fee - normal tx where its fullhash is the triggerhash<br />Alice tx - reftx using triggerhash<br />Bob fee - reftx using Alice tx fullhash<br />Bob tx - reftx using triggerhash and Alice tx as phase link<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am balancing the safety of Alice with the overall speed of transaction and avoiding the papercut attack<br /><br />In my protocol, Alice does determine the finish height and requires Bob to honor that, else she will not broadcast the trigger tx.<br /><br />I do not see why the contents of the Alice feetx (triggertx) is relevant to Bob. He doesnt really care what the details of the triggertx are, just as long as the main Alicetx will be triggered by it also. As it is, I am close to max capacity of the data packet and cant fit in another set of unsigned tx and sighash on top for the feetx.<br /><br />It sounds like I didnt miss anything and it is really cool to see a complete tx cycle happen in about 3 seconds. Then the next block has the trigger tx, followed by Alice tx and Bobtx, and the next block Bob's feetx. then a few blocks later the phased tx reaches its finish height and all is official.<br /><br />It would make things that much more better, if a phasedtx would finish as soon as all its requirement are met. at least for the phaselink type. Also having a worst case time for a block to be capped at 5 or 10 minutes. Those two things would allow the settings for a finish height 7 blocks in the future with a one hour deadline quite safe from all of the issues I can see. <br /><br />The tradeoff appears to require the max finish height to be (deadline / blocktime) blocks in the future. Since the further in the future the finish height is, the safer. the fact that the blocktime can be up to one hour and that is usually followed by half hour, 15 minutes, 7 minutes, I have to tie up funds for 2 hours.<br /><br />Still I believe this implementation offers a balanced tradeoff between time that trade is locked, the time it is fully confirmed, the risk factor against evil forgers, etc.<br /><br />James

But unless this is one of the high fee transaction types (i.e. asset issuance or MS currency issuance), the extra fee for phasing is just 1 NXT for voting model 4 (by-transaction), so Bob will lose 2 NXT as fee. I would optimize for the most common case, which is that both actors are honest, and Bob will have been prepared to pay the fee in this case anyway.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>allowing a 2NXT cost for failed completion opens a &quot;papercut&quot; attack vector. A malicious node could start accepting all orderbook offers and simply cost people 2NXT, multiplied across the board.<br /><br />Granted it is not the mainstream case, but I dont want to allow such an attack vector.

					@jean-luc<br /><br />I am finalizing InstantDEX phasing method and wanted to verify I am not making mistake. I am thinking to have a deadline=120 for all the transactions in a group, so there is closure within an hour as to whether it happens or not.<br /><br />The following are the relevant fields:<br /><br />referencedTransactionFullHash -&gt; reftx<br />phased<br />phasingFinishHeight<br />phasingVotingModel=4<br />phasingQuorum=1<br />phasingLinkedFullHash -&gt;phaselink<br /><br />I want to create an atomic group of transactions that have an &quot;all or none&quot; behavior that is immune to any sort of attack, with worst case behavior being loss of fee.<br /><br />There are 4 transactions: Alice fee, Alice tx, Bob fee and Bob tx<br /><br />Alice creates a feetx locally and defines a finish height for the group (ranging from 3 to 10 blocks in the future based on value of tx), but no reftx and not phased. This will be the trigger tx that when confirmed should cause all the others to get confirmed, or in the worst case, it is the only one confirmed and the fee is lost.<br /><br />Alice also creates the Alicetx that is a transfer/payment to Bob. this one uses the fullhash of the trigger tx as its reftx, but it is not phased as I want to use a streamlined one step offchain protocol. Alice sends the finishheight, unsigned txbytes, sighash and fullhash for alicetx to Bob offchain.<br /><br />Bob verifies that Alicetx properly generates fullhash and verifies the tx details and assuming it is correct, creates his real tx as phased tx using the fullhash of Alicetx as phaselink and triggerhash as reftx. Bob's fee tx (not phased) would use Alice tx's full hash as its reftx and broadcasts both of these into the unconfirmed txpool.<br /><br />Alice verifies that Bob's tx are as agreed to and broadcasts both of her tx and assuming they are confirmed, it trigger's Bob's tx and all are happy.<br /><br />Alice fee - normal tx where its fullhash is the triggerhash<br />Alice tx - reftx using triggerhash<br />Bob fee - reftx using Alice tx fullhash<br />Bob tx - reftx using triggerhash and Alice tx as phase link<br /><br />Of course the tricky cases are when not all 4 tx are confirmed due to whatever reason.<br /><br />In the event Bob doesnt broadcast his tx, nothing happens<br /><br />In the event Alice broadcasts the feetx but not the real tx, she loses the fee but nothing else happens (other than Bob's acct is having lower reserves until finish height and deadline)<br /><br />In the event Alice broadcasts her realtx but not the feetx, other than temporary reserve locks, nothing happens as all the tx are needing the fee tx to be there.<br /><br />so far so good. Now onto edge case scenarios, ie deadline happens before finish height or only a subset of the 4 tx are confirmed for whatever crazy reason due to reorgs, etc.<br /><br />Bob's tx cant be accepted unless the feetx has been confirmed along with Alice's tx, so his side seems quite secure.<br />Alice tx would be confirmed when the alice fee tx is confirmed, but Alice is not broadcasting the trigger until she see's both of Bob's tx in the unconfirmed pool, so barring consecutive blocks all being forged by an attacker, the Bob tx will be confirmed.<br /><br />The question is if there is an edge case of Bob's tx expiring before finish height leading to alice tx being confirmed but bob's tx expiring? My understanding is that as long as there are two blocks before the deadline, then Alice wont ever be in the situation where her tx is confirmed but bob's isnt.<br /><br />If alice fee tx triggerhash is confirmed at block B, then alice tx and bob's fee tx is confirmed at block B+1 and bob's tx at finish height.<br /><br />The tradeoff is that the smaller the finishheight, the easier it is for evil forger to attack, but the larger the finish height the more likely alice tx is confirmed but bob's tx expires.<br /><br />James<br /><br /><br /><br />
