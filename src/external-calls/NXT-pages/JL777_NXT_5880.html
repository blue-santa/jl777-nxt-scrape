(ill try not to be too bad i just want it to at-least approximately look as nice and feel as slick in operation as bitmit did)<br /><br />any idea on an eta for multigateway? it can be pretty rough just a general idea ya know. <br /><br />yea auctions would be cool. im trying to keep it from getting out of hand by limiting the total number of features. there is already going to be so much work to be done to get it to the level of a product that consumers actually want to use. maybe ill go back and fund stretch goals after the fact. <br /><br />thanks for all the help so far!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There is a reason I dont do GUIs <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />I prefer to stay out of subjective areas, so go wild and harass the GUI guys<br />I've been stalled for two weeks on multigateway due to all the testnet resets and problems, but it finally looks like it is working well. I figure a few days to get all the main paths tested and debugged, then a week to deal with issues raised by code review. The review is happening now starting with the parts that have been stable.<br /><br />So, barring any surprises around two weeks, or about the same time as AE goes live. I still have to deal with porting websockets to ubuntu (should be easy) and windows (yuk!). I agree that ubuntu, Mac and Windows are the platforms that we need to support<br /><br />James

					Latest release has removed the strange behavior. Spent the last day on NXTorrent, but it uses the same NXTprotocol/websockets framework, so I ended up getting a forms based local webpage that talks to multigateway.<br /><br /><a href="http://209.126.71.170/api.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.71.170/api.html</a><br /><br />So now I can finally debug multigateway and with an easy to use web form I hope it will go quickly.

I will match NXT for NXT that the committee authorizes, up to a limit of 50,000 NXT.

Latest version is working fine in my initial tests, not sure how many little issues are left, but I feel that we should be ~2 weeks away. Time to start the countdown?<br /><br />Anyway, NXT is decentralized and there are many people with many different marketing ideas. The latest blue look is cool, maybe we can do a relaunch with the new cool blue and AE.<br /><br />It seems that there are many different factions now in NXT that sometimes dont get along at all. I think it makes sense for people to disagree to not work together. So, I would like to put up some of the NXTcommunityfunds for what you are advocating, with the understanding that like minded people will join you. People that disagree should make their own group.<br /><br />Decision making must be streamlined. Whatever team is formed needs to unanimously declare which of them is more equal than the others and thus has the ability to make decisions. This is a short term project.

How long a tracker's data is valid for, I have no idea.<br /><br />If this was a separate project, I am sure I can come up with some sort of practical way of maximizing practical value of tracker data delivered vs. blockchain space used.<br /><br />James
