To separate out the different features would require analyzing each block and extracting anything that changes the state of a specific feature.<br /><br />We now have referenced transactions, and any transaction can refer to any other. That means there is a pool of unconfirmed transactions that are not in the blockchain that most definitely affect the state. An AM tx can be conditionally linked to a poll tx.<br /><br />With bitcoin it is just sendmoney that needs to be kept track of. With NXT it is all these other tx's and the type of tx's are growing every week!<br /><br />I am not sure that the entropy of the entire blockchain is identical to the total state, but it does seem to be on the same order. Which means that this problem maps to lossless compressing of the blockchain. Just did a quick test on the NXT db file and got a 3:1 compression. Now, with some higher level data representations, I would estimate a 10:1 compression rate would be achievable.<br /><br />Then, we can simply store compressed snapshots of the blockchain at trusted locations, publish the hash to allow new nodes to load the latest blockchain 10 times faster. The problem is with the RAM state, eg. referenced TX<br /><br />Do the tx with referenced tx appear in the blockchain? Or are they purely in RAM of the nodes that were online when it was broadcast? If the latter, what happens if a referenced tx is pending for so long and a lot (of stake) of new nodes appear and then we could get a scenario where a totally valid referenced tx ends up on a fork because none of the new nodes find out about it. If nodes are exchanging unconfirmed tx, then it might open up an attack vector for injecting false pending transactions. So, either way this is done, I see potential issues...<br /><br />Ok, back to the blockchain pruning. I think if we did the compression thing with one modification, it could be a nice practical tradeoff. Just parse out &quot;expired&quot; AM's before compressing. The expiration date can be determined by the amount of fee paid. I think a lot of the blockchain bloat will be from AM's. <br /><br />James

When the TX that refers to another TX is accepted, it reserves the NXT required (and an extra 100NXT to prevent DOS attack), so if the tx is accepted by the network, we can assume that it will clear<br /><br />Let&#039;s say Bob is paying Alice some NXT, so Alice creates a txA and gives the fullhash to bob. Only Alice has the ability to broadcast txA. Now Bob makes a payment to Alice, but it refers to txA. He doesnt have the signed bytes, but he can verify the transaction details and that it does indeed generate the fullhash. In this scenario, it actually doesnt matter, but if both transactions are NXT based, it is pretty important.<br /><br />OK, so now Bob doesnt broadcast the tx, but rather signs the tx and sends the signed tx bytes to Alice. She can verify the contents, also that it is signed and also that it refers to her txA. This is like having a signed check in pocket. However, Bob could turn evil and spend all the NXT in the acct, so alice needs to submit the tx and make sure it is accepted by the network. Now maybe she needs to wait for the next block to be sure, but actually it wont appear in the block chain. maybe it will appear as an unconfirmed tx in other nodes. Havent checked that part out yet. <br /><br />the key is that Alice is the one who broadcast it, so she knows it was submitted to the network. Can Evil bob submit a draining tx at the same time and invalidate Alice&#039;s? Maybe, not sure about that point, it wont be 100% effective and anybody that starts doing stuff like that gets a bad feedback real fast. <br /><br />I guess if we want to be really paranoid, we can have 100 nodes submit the tx at the same time and verify that all of them get accepted. It would be really hard for Evil bob to overturn a 100 times confirmed tx broadcast

The network needs active forgers<br />2. The number of transactions, therefore the usefulness of Nxt as a currency, needs low fees<br />3. Inflation is evil <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />4. Investors need to know how things work and be convinced that it won't change depending on votes or any other unpredictable means. <span class="bbc_u">Investors like stability</span>.<br /><br />From this I deduce that fees are necessary, and that their amount must fall between what forgers will accept to be forging (and accept to own and hold) and what consumers will accept to pay to use Nxt.<br />But since Nxt is still young, its value is meant to rise and with it the number of transactions.<br /><br />The only way I see to solve that equation is to define a variable fee, depending on the use of the network.<br />So this would be an idea to work with : why not decide that a forger should reasonably get 1 or 2% of interest per year ? In the long run, this seems to be a good choice for the equivalent of a bank account. Based on that, to be able to guaranty that percentage, the value of the fees should be able to get adapted to the volume of transactions. The more transactions on the network, the less individual fees would be necessary.<br />It could work based on a calculation made every day of the number of transactions of the previous day, and from there assume that this number would not change much from one day to the next. By a simple division, the amount for the fees could then be calculated.<br /><br />Doing this could be really nice, I think, for a mature network. But we're not there yet. So we could imagine 2 ways to define fees values : The one I just described and the one currently used. Then we can decide that, starting at a specific number of transactions per day, the system would automatically switch from the current system to the next.<br /><br />Question : Would the amount of the fees depend on the value of the transaction ? (that would encourage small transactions and even spamming if not well thought of) If not, large transactions would be advantaged and that may not be good for poor countries. May be a mix between both approaches would work best, including minimum and maximum fees.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, such a system would properly satisfy the prerequisites I identified above :<br />1. Forgers will get paid, and saving will earn interests<br />2. Nxters will not pay too much for using this currency<br />3. No inflation<br />4. Stable and predictable system. (And that's a major point)<br /><br />If I identified the prerequisites correctly, it seems to me like a good system.<br /><br />What do you think ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Current min tx fee is too high. When it is lowered to 0.1 NXT, I predict total forging revenues will more than double. Empty blocks will become rare. As the tx fee goes lower, more and more things become possible.<br /><br />For example to do a BTC &lt;-&gt; NXT trustless exchange requires 100 transactions. For a 1 BTC trade maybe its ok, but a lot more of these trades will happen if the cost was 10 NXT.<br />There are data publishing services that become cost prohibitive at 1 NXT per block, thats ~1000 NXT per day. Even at 100 NXT per day, it is on the high side, but still a lot more practical.<br /><br />Also, current everytime you place a bid or ask on the AE, it costs 1 NXT. Just for putting a quote. 1 NXT is clearly too high.<br /><br />I think everybody will be happy when the tx costs go down and the total forging revenues go up<br /><br />James

In fact I already have it coded and just need to debug it.<br /><br />NXTsubatomic cross chain transactions create synchronized and overlapped micropayment channels <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_party" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_party</a>. This allows both parties to incrementally receive their portion in a trustless way, except for the chance that you end up short 1 micropayment, currently 1%. The percentage can be reduced, but that increases the time to complete the exchange. Currently, once the payments get going, 1% gets exchanged each second.<br /><br />NXTatomic swaps implements escrow of any NXT txA for any NXT txB, eg. txX can be sending NXT or NXT assets (or any other transaction). It uses a process similar to what is described in <a href="https://nxtforum.org/nrs-releases/nrs-v0-9-9/msg10942/#msg10942" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/nrs-releases/nrs-v0-9-9/msg10942/#msg10942</a><br />NXTatomic swap creates a linked pair of transactions, either both happen or neither happen, other than the edge case when the party that holds the trigger transaction waits until the deadline and only his tx gets through. since that is against his interest, I am ignoring this possibility.<br /><br />I have a third case, which has no name yet, where I create a hybrid NXTsubatomic/NXTatomic by creating a micropayment channel equivalent for NXT. This allows direct exchange of BTC &lt;-&gt; NXT in a trustless way.<br /><br />My concern is with <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=515370.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=515370.0</a>, it isnt exactly the same, but I dont fully understand malleability and so I worry that the same sort of thing could mess up the micropayments.<br /><br />My understanding is that after the funding transaction is confirmed, then receiving a signed tx using the outputs of the funding tx is as good as receiving payment. Since the funding tx went into a multisig acct that you are a signer of, you can be assured that there are no other transactions that can take precedence. <br /><br />To setup a BTC &lt;-&gt; NXT exchange, bob wants to send nancy 1 BTC in exchange for 20,000 NXT.<br /><br />bob creates an unbroadcast funding tx into a 2:2 multisig acct to get its txid. He uses that txid to create a refund tx back to himself that isnt valid for 24hrs and sends the rawtransaction to nancy. she signs it and sends it back to bob who then broadcasts the funding tx. Bob also creates any NXT tx just to create a fullhash that can be used by nancy and sends the raw data to her.<br /><br />Nancy uses the NXT fullhash to create a referenced tx that pays bob 200NXT and sends it to bob. bob verifies nancy&#039;s tx decodes properly and sends nancy the signed tx bytes for .01 BTC<br /><br />As each side receives the micropayment, they create a new micropayment that is 1% more, until 100% is done<br /><br />Bob then broadcasts his NXT tx and nancy&#039;s 100% payment to him, they get confirmed in the following two blocks<br />nancy broadcasts the 100% payment to her, this invalidates the refund tx since it uses the same utxo of the funding tx<br /><br />My big question is if there are any points in the above sequence where one side is more than 1% out of pocket.<br /><br />Hmmmm. Now that I write this, I think nancy can empty her NXT acct so the transactions she is sending to bob will fail when it gets submitted. I will need to change the process a bit so that bob needs to broadcast the tx&#039;s he is getting from nancy to make sure it gets accepted by the network. It wont confirm until the trigger tx is broadcast but bob will have assurance that nancy cant drain the acct. The practical considerations are that currently it will cost 100NXT in tx fees and require 10000 NXT in reserves for the duration.<br /><br />Ok, so with the modification that bob is verifying with the NXT network that nancy&#039;s tx&#039;s are accepted, do you see any flaws?<br /><br />James<br /><br />There is another way to implement BTC &lt;-&gt; NXT in a single pair of transactions, but it requires creating nonstandard bitcoin tx,which is only accepted by one mining pool and could take hours or even a day to get confirmed, it also appears vulnerable to malleability, so I chose the micropayments method instead.

My sockpuppet ratings would then be fed into others ratings (albeit at maybe 30%) but could enough sockpuppets skew the results enough to scam $5000 in selling a car? <br /><br />If there are variable weightings for users, they would need to be kept in a range? <br /><br />Although, we have trustless exchange right?

Unless you can convince others to also use you and your sockpuppets as a reference, you will be the only one that has such a high rating.<br /><br />Presumably all the sockpuppets would essentially be like an island without any connections to real people. Now, the danger is that somebody that does real transactions will try to boost their rating by sockpuppet trading and once they get others to give them decent ratings, the sockpuppets will also inherit this. This is why I feel an exponential dropoff is needed for each extra link. Or maybe just zero out any indirect ratings unless there is nothing else to go on.<br /><br />As soon as people find out the sockpuppet nature, they will get negative ratings and things should correct pretty quickly. I think it is important that you dont buy anything expensive from a seller that you dont directly trust or someone you trusts directly trusts.<br /><br />James

					Ignore the fact that it seems a lot of windows is still running 32bit stuff, this is an annoyance as &quot;long&quot; is only 32 bits and address space is limited unless you do segment stuff, etc. I finally did manage to get all my stuff to compile and even link. It took 10 times as long to get it to link, that is why I like to have all my source files just include each other. No linker to worry about. No need to keep updating .h files to match the changing function interfaces. You do have to be careful in what order you include them, but compared to tracking down mysterious missing DLL's and missing functions, .lib files which maybe have the code, or maybe not. hope you have the matching dll, etc, etc.<br /><br />Anyway, the sourceware pthreads crashed, so I switched to libuv. That one actually worked. I found a few more system dependencies, like using /dev/urandom, but luckily I already had nacl/libsodium so I just switched to randombytes. <br /><br />It actually loads and runs and even 127.0.0.1:7777 has the form.<br /><br />However, the windows networking is all wrong. In unix, the sockets are compatible with file handles, not so for Windows. So this means I need to rewrite all the networking code of NXTsync. The original code used that method.<br /><br />So I am at a crossroads. I can &quot;simply&quot; port the tcp and udp calls into a portable layer (which I need to write) or I can port it to libuv. Both are probably about the same amount of work. The latter runs the risk of hole punching not working as I might not be able to control the process enough to maintain the &quot;magic&quot;, but if it works it will be a nice improvement and will ease the shift to a totally libuv based control flow. The former has a better chance of maintaining&nbsp; the hole punching magic, but wont have the benefit of partial migration to libuv.<br /><br />James

It is a very complicated system though, so I guess anything could happen.<br /><br />If there is a lot of separation, then I think all ratings should be close to neutral. It is pretty meaningless if the only thing we know about a person is that some person who rated another person who rated yet another person rated that person positively/negatively.<br /><br />There is a lot we can do with this. Each person can specify how they want to calculate this. They can even say, rank them as if I was somebody else. Or even create some combination of rankings out of what other people's rankings would be.<br /><br />Maybe all we need to do is one level using that approach. Each person when they are getting started would list half a dozen to a dozen people they trust and set the ranking to be equal weights of what those people have. Kind of like creating a virtual rating system by compositing other people's rankings. Then as you end up with more and more direct feedback, that portion starts becoming more and more relevant.<br /><br />Once I get NXT(sub)atomic transactions fully integrated, we can even have the total amount of crypto traded as part of the feedback system.<br /><br />In any case, until we get lots of users, it will be hard to know if the feedback system is working as we want it. I think once we get into a beta test we can start getting some &quot;actual&quot; feedbacks and I think this feature will continue to evolve as time goes on. I am not totally satisfied with it, after all it was just my first attempt at this<br /><br />On the searching/browsing side, we now have three tags and three categories. Until there are enough listings ,the current list 100 approach will be fine. The sooner you can get enough real looking listings into the blockchain, the sooner I will be able to get the searching/browsing finished. It is hard to solve this in a vacuum.<br /><br />Sephr hasnt come through with the aria2 port. From the low level, the magnet link is the only real substantial thing left. Do you know how to make a magnet link file and get it out into the cloud? If you dont know, how will people be able to do this and if they cant do it, what benefit is there to supporting it? Maybe you can find a program that lets people author the magnet link contents and pushes it to the peers?<br /><br />James
