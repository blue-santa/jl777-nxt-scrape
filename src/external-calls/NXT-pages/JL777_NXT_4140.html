If the venture fails for whatever reason, he is responsible. <br /><br />If he points fingers to others, or is not taking responsibility for the decisions he made, that is a very bad sign. <br /><br />If he apologizes sincerely, or even makes your loss whole, that is good, but until then, he is not to be entrusted with any more money!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />so you would agree then, that what jl777 is not considered scamming, but what bm1 has done is?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Honestly for me that is not clear. <br /><br />What seems certain is that James payed BM money for delivery of something. <br /><br />Sure it is not delivered, and he is not willing to pay it back. <br /><br />But this does not mean that BM scammed, or that James scammed. <br /><br />But equally both may be scammers. <br /><br />Scam is used quickly as a word but a true scam is something that was sold under false pretenses. It is very hard to decide whether this was the case as even the scammer himself will believe his own stories that they will deliver, and even for the people close to this person it may take years before they realise this person is a scammer. I speak from experience sadly.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" /><br /><br />For example, here the project is not delivered and the story is that this is because BM did not do any work, or started talking trash about NXT. But then his story is that he did do work, and that he still wants to continue the project. He also says that James blew up the project. This may all be true too. It is one word vs another and who is to be believed? Probably the truth is somewhere in the middle. <br /><br />Now, I am biased, I don't trust James from the start. But frankly I had a hard time myself judging whether he was too good to be true, or the real deal. He is so active, sets up so much. And we all profit since he basically kickstarted the asset exchange. He also promises the sky, involves so many people. <br /><br />So I couldn't really speak out. But I see that many people have a very high confidence and trust in him. I see this especially in this thread because here we have a first project that blows up. Now, I would expect people to wisen up and also become more critical of James. But what I see happening is that all the blame is directed towards someone else. And that is why I speak up, because clearly most blame is with James as it is his project, he is the manager, he sold it to the investors, he received the money from the investors! <br /><br /><br />Now, he says he will make investors whole, pay them back. But the way he does that is by taking money from other investors, some other asset. This is another red flag. Look, if he was an honest entrepreneur before investors put money in, he would warn people of the risks of this project, so that if it fails the investors were warned and he does not have to feel guilty. He would also not pay the bill if it fails, not from his own pocket, and certainly not from another asset/investor his pockets. It seems that he is very focused on his reputation, even if that means paying unjustly angry investors. This looks to me that he is hiding something. <br /><br />What I think, and this is pure speculation, he is hiding, is that he is a scammer, in the meaning that he promises things, that he knows he will not deliver. Or, if he is unconscious of this and he really believes that he will deliver, that he will end up not delivering and so he is a bad entrepreneur. The evidence for that is what did he actually deliver? Because I have heard other voices that say he is all talk. If you can show me that he actually delivered something, that would be a positive indicator, though not conclusive! The scammers I have known delivered, but the product did not even come close to what was said it would, and they knew.&nbsp; <br /><br />I could be wrong, but to answer your question, BM may be a scammer, and James may be a scammer. I don't know.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am making good from my personal holdings of jl777hodl, which does not impact the price of any other assets.<br />A lot of people seem to highly value real world practices of contracts, lawsuits, courts, lawyers, etc.<br />There is no need for crypto if that is what you want.<br /><br />I am providing the makegood because there is clearly an expectation that the main dev for a project will be dedicated to NXT and to his project. My reliance on real world identity is what caused this error, plus the fact that I am too trusting of others as I expect them to be like me.<br /><br />I believe business should be able to be done with a handshake or the online equivalent. Honor what the intent of the deal is. If something unexpected comes up, deal with it with integrity. If you have to work out every detail for every contingency and every recourse to be taken upon each case, well that is a contract and to me that means there is no trust between the two parties and to enforce this you need a giant legal framework.<br /><br />99% of the people in crypto are people that feel like me and when they agree to something, they will either do it or if something changes, do their best to fix it.<br /><br />A lot of people have put a lot of trust in me and I take that very seriously. Here is my first big mistake and while I can hide behind the &quot;law&quot; or &quot;cryptos are risky&quot; position, I feel that would go against the trust people have given me. I want to set an example for other asset issuers to follow that if their asset blows up for whatever reason, that a reasonable makegood be offered. No need for long lawsuits, trials, appeals, etc. Just do what is right and move on.<br /><br />It is important for NXT that people be able to have confidence in AE and and issuers in general. We need to set a new standard on how to deal with these sort of issues without adopting the real world legal system. Since we really cant have an enforceable court system, this is not just my political views, but a practical necessity.<br /><br />Now I have to get back to coding<br /><br />James

					jl777 is in the house<br />MGW servers are almost caught up<br />There is a bug where after running for many hours or a day, NXTservices gets a gap in its block lookup array and MGW waits forever for the new block<br /><br />I will keep trying new versions to fix this, but it does take a long time to even know if a fix worked.<br /><br />Also, MGW init sequence used to go much faster, something I did recently really seems to have slowed it down. Maybe I am running out of RAM on the servers... Then again it could be because I was running them in the background so it wouldnt die when my ISP changed IP addresses.<br /><br />I will just stop sleeping and run MGW in the foreground <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. BTC is perfectly balanced and LTC is off by 0.00026368, but I think that is due to the 4 decimal places especially since it is a positive balance. all fifth decimal and beyond end up as a credit to MGW

Close the thread. Leave this one for karma to work out. Endless discussion is what BM wants. I lost a lot, but I'm realistic, crypto is risky territory. There's no way to get the money back, and knowing bluemeanie's name &amp; address can't help me as I live in another country.<br /><br />Please lock this thread.<br /><br />Support the people who are obviously trying to get things done. I support James. James might have made some bad decisions along the way, but he made them in good faith, and I believe he is an honest person trying to work constructively with other parties. He doesn't hide the fact that he wants to make money and is supremely motivated &amp; hard working, but he's not trying to rip people off either.<br /><br />Bluemeanie appears to be motivated by other things, including attention, so lock this thread and move on. By all means make contact with BM in private (I tried but could see it was going nowhere fast), but lock this 'trophy' thread asap.<br /><br />We've all seen the psycho movies. This thread is like a handbag or a pair of panties to a serial killer rapist (it's a psycho trophy), and every post is giving BM a psycho rush. <br /><br />The best way to get him back is to ignore him, which I'll do from now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>bm said that he will refund funds to any investors if they contact him<br />I guess he didnt?<br /><br />Since he wont take responsibility, it falls on me to do so. After all I did make the horrible mistake of trusting bm. So PM me and we can figure out how best to make good.<br /><br />As I posted yesterday I will protect investors by providing credits based on what you paid for it or 13 NXT which was yesterday's price before all this. I suggest to suspend trading of NXTautoDAC, if bm wants to actually write code then he is free to create a market with the assets he still has, but after the make good, I will have no more to do with NXTautoDAC or bm, it is just a waste of my precious time.<br /><br />noashh has volunteered to be the pointman for processing the claims. Please provide the number of NXTautoDAC assets you had as of yesterday, all relevant txids, how much you paid, etc. and what amount of credit you calculate. I will try to honor what you feel is the right amount for the claim, but please use the 13 NXT price as the amount per asset. You can also calculate an extra amount for any difference from 13NXT that I will use to give you allocation of future NXTventure assets. I hope this makes sense. I have already paid out the 1 million via NXTventure and in order not to hurt NXTventure from this &quot;NXTventure&quot; mistake, I am taking personal responsibility for having too much faith in a long time BCT member. I do not have the NXT to use for the makegood, so it will have to be in the form of assets and jl777hodl is the most horizontal asset that spans not only my assets but many others and I feel it is the best way to fund the makegood. If you have a preference for any other asset, just let noashh know and i will see what i can do. The sooner we can all get this behind us the better, so please get your claims in before Friday. I will try to get this all done by this weekend or early next week at the latest.<br /><br />I am definitely feeling the pain from this and will definitely make changes in any future asset issuances.<br /><br />I notice that bm keeps saying he isnt anonymous and I am, but just follow the money. The non-anonymous person is keeping the 1 million NXT and the anonymous person is providing the makegood. Maybe non-anonymity is overrated? I dont think people being anonymous changes who they are, so just judge a person by their actions not whether they are anonymous or not. One factor that led me to trust bm in the beginning was because he wasnt anonymous. I too, overrated that factor. No more. I dont care anymore whether someone is anonymous or not, I will judge them purely from what I see them do. I suggest the same<br /><br />James

Not $15K USD. Are you saying that you planned this from the beginning? You intentionally didnt sell any assets because you knew that you would use this flimsy defense?<br />Well I have some news for you. If you look at the cashflow and asset flow, you ended up with 300000 assets and 1 million NXT and NXTventure got 450000 assets. This asset is based around what you promised to do, a description you signed off on, and pretty much everybody would interpret that as you sold assets for 1 million NXT<br /><br />I want you to refund to investors because that is the right thing to do. You know it is, so does everybody else.<br /><br />James<br /><br />Edit: &quot;THAT&quot; money you refer to I raised is where the 1 million NXT came from. Happened the same day

Due to their automated nature the fees charged to people can be dramatically less than real world equivalents. The much lower fees are expected to entice enough people to try this new technology and thus increasing the customer base. The ability to easily utilize autoDACs will be integrated into NXTservices and this will encourage adoption. While autoDAC's have a tremendous potential, it is still in its infancy and it is expected that it will take a while for people to become comfortable with using autoDACs Please follow updates on the NXTventure section<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />nice try James.&nbsp; No where do you state that this paragraph(which had little meaning at the time- and still does) is going into the AE asset description.&nbsp; Nice touch with other cut and pastes.&nbsp; Should I stoop to your level and pick out little tidbits from our past discussions?<br /><br />-bm<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

This was by skype which you always insist on, I guess cuts down on the evidence against you that you have to deal with.<br /><br />from the email where you agreed to receive payment:<br /><br />****<br />Quote from: bluemeanie1 on May 15, 2014, 05:12:25 am<br /><br />ok if what were talking about here is a way to monetize my work with DACs on NXT I am 100% on board with this.<br /><br />-bm<br />****<br /><br />and to make sure that you are not surprised where the money came from:<br /><br />****<br /><br />yes that's correct: 11274042109288826540<br /><br />glad to be on board!&nbsp; &nbsp;also: good analogy.&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />-bm<br />****<br /><br />Now when somebody tells me they are &quot;100% on board&quot;, confirms the address get funds and confirms it again with &quot;glad to be on board!&quot; all sandwiched around the asset description and the description of cashflow and assets:<br /><br />****<br />So a total of 750,000 assets<br />you get 25% of revenue stream, 1 million NXT upfront and 300,000 assets<br />****<br /><br />Well, usually when that happens I dont interpret it as &quot;I don't understand what the descriptor is actually saying&quot;<br /><br />So here is clear proof that you knew what the asset was, you agreed to the terms, you accepted the funds. All the things you denied earlier.<br /><br />James<br />
