He will probably buy in small portions to hold the price down before the announcement comes that this coin joins the supernetwork. So basically it's an IPO for a fund with inside information <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>A fundamental change in a coin that leads to its revaluation by the market is not a pump.<br />Supernetwork intends to obtain meaningful amounts of the coin's that join, whale will be doing the negotiating (if he can find the time).<br /><br />So like the sharkfund had 10% of BBR, then BBR agrees to join Supernetwork and its price quadruples. Yes, this will happen, but it wont really help a fund with 10000 BTC to have quadrupled 10 BTC.<br /><br />A lot of coins wont have 10% available (no whales) so the community would have to do a fund raiser to get 10% raised to be exchanged for BTC as a condition for acceptance. Any such exchange would be done at the trailing average price before the fund raising starts so any boost from the anticipation of being accepted wont skew the price and with acceptance contingent on raising the amount, there is some chance a community rejects this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly, using thousands of BTC for the potential coins would be a huge overkill. I'm wondering what the remaining funds of SuperNetwork will be used for.<br /><br />BUt I do not get your last paragraph; the candidate coins community needs to do a fundraiser? So you'll not buy the coins off exchanges but you'll require the community to hand over 10% of total coins? I'm confused.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>have you ever tried to buy 10% of a coin?<br />it is not easy. <br />there is no handing over of coins, but there does need to be the coins that are willing to be sold at the pre-joining price<br />what part of this is confusing?<br />there is no way to buy 10% of any coin without causing a big price bubble, which is harmful. I am not allowed to harm a crypto<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So you'll either need a community effort or few major holders to collect and send you the coins. Either way, you have to let some people know that they are SuperNet candidates. Wouldn't people abuse that?<br />Once the word is out, everyone will expect the price to go up. Wouldn't that cause a price pump? There would be people who will sacrifice short-term gains by allowing to sell you at a fixed price but there will be some people to abuse it and instead of selling you at a fixed rate, they will collect the coins from the market and wait until SuperNet announcement rockets the price.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So you are saying that SuperNET will be making money but maybe some other people will buy up their coin to gain from the expected price gain too.<br /><br />My priority is to make sure SuperNET gets the price before any increase due to SuperNET, that seems fair. What happens with the other coins being traded, well that is trading. There is a buyer and seller, so if they both know the possibility of a coin joining SuperNET and they trade, what abuse has happened?<br />

If I wanted to make just a hobby for this I could do all the small coins from sharkfund0<br />I estimate a need for around 10000 BTC. This should be enough to fully populate the Teleport Station with quite a few top 30 coins<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are considering adding few top30 coins?<br /><br />I assumed that you are going add &quot;unique&quot; coins which could have some advantages over others; BBR as a CN fork for example and several more to fill in the gaps to have a giant network where SuperNetwork is able to do ANYTHING any other coin do.<br /><br />But now it seems more like you want to form a coin syndicate/union .<br /><br />Edit: which isn't a bad thing, BTW. Just something else I initially thought of<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>To be eligible to become part of the core of SuperNET, a coin has to have something unique, now most of the top coins do have something unique<br />I expect initially I will run out of appropriate coins before I run out of BTC, but with the clear message that just forking a coin gets no consideration at all, then we will find more and more coins that are making unique features to be able to directly tap into the 100,000+ userbase of SuperNET<br />

You shouldn't be overworking yourself with this and should focus on MGW more than anything.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This will only get worse the more and more people use the MGWs.&nbsp; What causes the MGWs to miss a payment?&nbsp; I'm guessing they crash and upon reboot don't scan the blockchain to see if they have missed processing a withdrawal, correct?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the withdraw problems are due to the 1.2.5 release breaking GUI, so all withdraws done by the older GUI require manual fiddling<br />restarting the MGW is the best way to get them all in sync, I am doing this now<br />they crash when the system runs out of memory. These are dev servers. I run new code on them. sometimes no space, MGW gets a fatal error due to lack of resources<br /><br />the other problem is that my internet connect is so bad I cant login to one of the servers<br />thats the one that probably needs a kickstart...

Some here don't seem to trust the person that made the tweet I read, so I came to the source.<br /><br />My response to jl777 was unrelated to why I came here to post. In my view he's defending someone many of us in the cryptospace have some very serious doubts about (<em>cough</em>) and that not only amazed me, but pissed me off. Therefore a strong reaction was demanded to awaken the public to the bullshit that surrounds justabits presence in several crypto-communities. Every once in awhile people need a reminder so it doesn't happen again ... but it just keeps happening because he's very good at being a martyr ... and hiding (<em>I'll get to that in a moment</em>).<br /><br />The instances where justabit has been involved in and reacted in typical scammer ways have been discussed ad nauseam on the BTT and FTC forums. Hence my surprise to find someone so prominent in a community backing justabit. That needs to be corrected IMHO. I invested in NXT early, saw justabit popup and knew what was coming. I knew I was going to profit if I just kept my mouth shut but I also was aware of what would follow and how many would lose and that was bad for my long term investment in NXT. As it turned out I went ahead and profited, despite making everyone here aware ahead of time, because the circus that is justabit (<em>which keeps a growin'!</em>) was in town and my long term investment suddenly became a short term investment. The only satisfaction I can get personally from having to cash out on the hype-buyers is knowing I warned as many people as I could here, there and everywhere.<br /><br />So, I can't imagine why I would be upset. Some asshole keeps coming into my long term investments and pre-announcing a bunch of n00bs into premature coinjaculation to drive the price up so insiders can dump on them and then justify it (<em>when asked</em>) by saying shit like, &quot;but it leaves the price 20%-30% higher when it's done&quot;. No regards for the people that got scammed during hype-phase. No regards for the future/public opinion of the coin afterwards.<br /><br />I'll admit it, it's hard to complain about justabit ater you've profited from his hype. But I had higher hopes for NXT. <em><strong>I didn't want NXT to become another p&amp;d hype coin and I failed.</strong></em> <strong><em>I failed miserably.</em></strong> I drove most of you to John's defense as he went into unappreciated-poor-martyr-John mode. I did better work behind the scenes to raise awareness than I did publicly and for that I apologize. But in my defense, you must understand how strong the force is with justabit. He brings profits to the whales and others participating. Most of those people are well established in the communities he ventures into and he befriends them and he rarely does anything to lose their trust ... because they are not the target. You are little minnow. He needs them, he needs their funds and their clout otherwise he's just a guy spamming a forum with hype. They bring him legitimacy in the eyes of the uninitiated. Anyway, most of you know how this game works and it's worked on most all coins today. I guess I'm just butthurt that it was run on a coin I thought had a community that would not tolerate the bs, I was wrong. It was (<em>for the most part</em>) wholeheartedly accepted with open arms by the vast majority of this community and that means I have no place here now, so I will leave it be after this (<em>hopefully</em>).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/what-happened-to-cointropolis-justabit/msg93494/#msg93494">Quote from: WolfofCrypto on August 29, 2014, 01:37:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">But the reality is this John may of gone into hiding because public accusations <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why is that? <br /><br />Why do you think honest-John has to go into hiding over a &quot;few&quot; loud mouths trying to ruin all of honest-John's fun? (<em>Remember that time Elon Musk went into hiding because a few people typed, &quot;Paypal is a scam!&quot; on a forum. Yeah, me either.</em>)<br /><br />I think there'd be a lot more of us, but the rest of them grew tired chasing justabit around and pointing it out to everyone. It just so happened that he popped up on a coin I was a long term hodler in again and I knew he was going to fuck that shit all up just like last time.<br /><br />He found some followers here, so it looks like he'll be planted here for awhile, which is good for the p&amp;d crew and early adopters looking to cash out above 7k.<br /><br />So, 2-0 John ... you're still in the lead.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It seems that you are admitting to helping the dumping part, thanks so much for helping the NXT community by advising everybody you know to sell NXT<br /><br />I believe in &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; and I am not making any judgement on the cointropolis issue<br /><br />My point is that your constant bringing this up (and telling everyone you know to sell NXT) is harming NXT. It directly affects me, prevents me from concentrating on coding. So if your goal is to lower the price of NXT and to make me less productive, you succeed by this.<br /><br />THAT is the point of this. So if you continue this, you will be marked as a TROLL.<br />I am telling you that convincing everyone you know to sell NXT and doing things to make me less productive is the direct result of this activity. You are now warned. So if you continue this, then it is clear to all what your true objective is.<br /><br />James
