It's basically a free for all for anyone to start a MGW asset. Just thinking that if those who start setting up servers/assets either make mistakes or decide to scam coins, then users will just call the MGW as a whole untrustworthy and refuse to use it.<br /><br />I guess like assets, people will have to do due diligence on which mgwAsset they use.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It would need to have some sort of process to give us faith that they wont be naughty. For example, EvilDave wants to do it for some coins, so that seems good. Clearly, some newbie acct shouldnt get the ability to run a MGW for a prominent altcoin, but the alternative is to not support the coin as there is no way for us (me) to support much more than the handful we already support<br /><br />

					Here are the release notes of what I am about to test. I expect to be able to debug and release it tonight. So, if you want to experiment with running MGW server for any coin that is not BTC, LTC, DRK or BTCD, then you can start preparing the three servers and MGW.conf files<br /><br />James<br /><br />************* pre-release notes<br />I got tired of having to constantly fiddle with making new builds and also having multiple builds is not so easy to manage. Also, what about supporting new coins, changing servers, etc.<br /><br />So, I added support for an MGW.conf file. Just have the file in the same directory as the MGW daemon and it will load the parameters. The file format is one JSON string, the following are the fields:<br /><br />// if MAINNET is not specified or is 0, then it is testnet<br />&quot;MAINNET&quot;:1<br /><br />// if secret field is not there, then the randvals files will be used to generate secret<br />&quot;secret&quot;:&quot;&lt;account passphrase&gt;&quot;<br /><br />// Optional fields that will override the defaults:<br />&quot;MIN_NQTFEE&quot;:100000000<br />&quot;MIN_NXTCONFIRMS&quot;:10<br />&quot;ORIGBLOCK&quot;:&quot;&lt;hash of first block to start scanning&gt;&quot;<br />&quot;NXTAPIURL&quot;:&quot;<a href="http://127.0.0.1:7876/nxt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:7876/nxt</a>&quot;<br />&quot;NXTISSUERACCT&quot;:&quot;&lt;account that issued the MGW assets&gt;&quot;<br /><br />// MGW Fields:<br />&quot;GATEWAY_SIG&quot;:12345678<br />&quot;SERVER_PORT&quot;:666<br />&quot;MGW0_ipaddr&quot;:&quot;12.34.56.78&quot;<br />&quot;MGW1_ipaddr&quot;:&quot;87.65.43.21&quot;<br />&quot;MGW2_ipaddr&quot;:&quot;11.11.11.11&quot;<br />&quot;special_NXTaddrs&quot;:[&quot;&lt;MGW0&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;MGW1&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;MGW2&gt;&quot;,...]<br />&quot;active&quot;:[&quot;BTC&quot;,&quot;LTC&quot;,...]<br />&quot;coins&quot;:[{&lt;coin JSON&gt;},{&lt;coin JSON&gt;}...]<br /><br />The &lt;coin JSON&gt; is as follows, set NXTfee_equiv to be close to what 1 NXT is:<br />&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&lt;abbreviation for coin&gt;&quot;<br />&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;&lt;asset id for coin&gt;&quot;<br />&quot;txfee&quot;:0.0001<br />&quot;NXTfee_equiv&quot;:0.0001<br />&quot;rpc&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:666&quot;<br />&quot;conf&quot;:&quot;&lt;full path to configuration file for coin&quot;<br />&quot;blockheight&quot;:&lt;first block to start scanning blockchain from&gt;<br />&quot;minconfirms&quot;:10<br />&quot;estblocktime&quot;:300<br /><br />// optional fields to override defaults, probable no need to change these<br />&quot;nohexoutput&quot;:0<br />&quot;useaddmultisig&quot;:0<br />&quot;forkblock&quot;:0<br />&quot;pollseconds&quot;:60<br /><br />Once you designate a server as MGW0, then if that ever changes, all the deposit addresses have to change. By changing the SERVER_PORT and GATEWAY_SIG, you can run multiple MGW's on the same server and they will only look at the AM's with the matching signature. If you are testing with assets you issue yourself, you need to set NXTISSUERACCT. You can even use a remote server for API calls by changing NXTAPIURL, but probably not such a good idea. The ORIGBLOCK determines what block number NXTservices starts scanning the blockchain from. If you dont need historical data, just set it to a recent blockhash.<br /><br />// the following is a template for a MAINNET MGW that supports BTC and LTC<br />{<br />&nbsp; &quot;MAINNET&quot;:1, &quot;GATEWAY_SIG&quot;:1234567, &quot;SERVER_PORT&quot;:666,<br />&nbsp; &quot;MGW0_ipaddr&quot;:&quot;209.126.70.170&quot;, <br />&nbsp; &quot;MGW1_ipaddr&quot;:&quot;209.126.70.156&quot;, <br />&nbsp; &quot;MGW2_ipaddr&quot;:&quot;209.126.70.159&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &quot;special_NXTaddrs&quot;:[&quot;423766016895692955&quot;,&quot;12240549928875772593&quot;,&quot;8279528579993996036&quot;,&quot;5723512772332443130&quot;,&quot;15740288657919119263&quot;],<br />&nbsp; &quot;active&quot;:[&quot;BTC&quot;,&quot;LTC&quot;],<br />&nbsp; &quot;coins&quot;:[<br />{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;BTC&quot;,&quot;conf&quot;:&quot;/home/root/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf&quot;,&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;4551058913252105307&quot;,&quot;txfee&quot;:0.0001,&quot;NXTfee_equiv&quot;:0.0001,&quot;rpc&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:8332&quot;,&quot;blockheight&quot;:300797,&quot;forkblockheight&quot;:308539,&quot;minconfirms&quot;:3,&quot;estblocktime&quot;:600},<br />{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;LTC&quot;,&quot;conf&quot;:&quot;/home/root/.litecoin/litecoin.conf&quot;,&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;2881764795164526882&quot;,&quot;txfee&quot;:0.001,&quot;NXTfee_equiv&quot;:0.01,&quot;rpc&quot;:&quot;127.0.0.1:9332&quot;,&quot;blockheight&quot;:564980,&quot;forkblockheight&quot;:594965,&quot;minconfirms&quot;:5,&quot;estblocktime&quot;:150}]<br />}<br /><br />You can download a Universal MGW from <a href="http://209.126.70.170/uMGW" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://209.126.70.170/uMGW</a><br />It is only for Ubuntu and I dont expect this to change. Make sure to make a backups directory from where the coin daemons run from, usually something like ~/bitcoin/src/backups. Make sure to have the identical MGW.conf files on all three servers. The only thing that could change are the &quot;secret&quot; field, the locations of the coins .conf files and the rpc ip/port, everything else must match or the servers wont agree on things<br /><br />So now, you can run one (or three) customized MGW servers to support your favorite coin!<br />However, only use with NXT is authorized, any other usage is likely to end badly.<br />The following coins are supported, but only the ones with (*) have been verified:<br />BTC*, LTC*, DRK*, DOGE, CGB, BTCD, VRC, PPC, NMC, XC, VRC, ZET, QRK, RDD, XPM, FTC, CLOAK, VIA, MEC, URO, YBC, IFC, VTC, POT, KEY, FRAC, APC, VOOT, GML, SYNC, CRYPT, RZR, ICB, CYC<br /><br />OK, so maybe some of these coins dont support multisig or not quite compatible, but if it is a gen 1 coin, then there is a decent chance it will work out of the box. The further away from a pure bitcoin fork, the less likely. I still have 30 slots open and if you want to support a coin, then find two other like minded people, get a MGW.conf file that works, we can consider adding support for your MGW in the official MGW lite GUI. For a coin with low volumes, a VPS with 8 gigs of RAM should be adequate to be a MGW server. As long as you deal with issuing the asset and taking care of the servers, you can use it for free and have your favorite coin trade on NXT AE via MGW.<br /><br />With the ability to change the API URL, it is quite possible that NXT clones could just use this as is. If you are a NXT clone maker and are adding value, then I am open to cooperation, just contact me. I have a few conditions for allowing MGW to run on a clone. My interest is in making a globally decentralized infrastructure, so as long as you agree to participate in that, then I will most likely allow usage of MGW. For non-NXT clones, this applies, plus some sort of reasonable incentive (compensation) for porting.<br />

Proposed solutions were a dedicated faucet delivering 2 NXT (one for deposit address, and another for AE order placement) or provisionally a giveaway thread for crypto users with a brand new Nxt account to get started through MGW.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hadn't even thought about that, this is a pretty annoying fact.<br /><br />I think the faucet system we have at the moment can certainly do the job. It just has to implemented into the process so that it is very simple to do for new users, for example a popup window if you click generate with a zero fund with a link to the faucet. <br />Interim wise this should probably be mentioned in the depositing user guide for now.<br /><br />I was trying to think of an automated way that the new user paid for these at the end, by means of central fund being used to front the NXT and getting reimbursed at the end, but pretty sure there it isn't possible as the central fund private key couldn't be distributed and there is always an cost of using the nxt network. So think this part would always have to happen outside the network.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Does the BTC addess request message have to come from the requesting account? If not, it would be safer to create a faucet where the user passes his NXT account address, then the faucet sends the AM to request the BTC wallet address and sends out just 1 NXT to the user account. <br /><br />A faucet that sends out just one NXT to addresses with no transactions yet can't be robbed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Currently I do require the requesting acct to tokenize all requests, but I am thinking of relaxing that requirement for deposit address requests.<br /><br />If somebody can get me example C source code for a .cgi (?) program that I can drop into an Apache configuration (I also need to know where the directory is!), then I can write a &quot;realtime&quot; deposit address generator that would bypass the blockchain for the request. The danger is of course spam, but I think if I limited access to a specific lists of IP addresses, then it would not be an issue. Also some sort of cap on the number of requests, probably set by sending in a deposit to cover the costs of the AM's that do go out.<br /><br />I just dont know how to get the output of C code to an html page. So as soon as I get the example Apache .cgi (not even sure if that is what it is!), I can make a webpage where you send in a NXT address and it spits back the JSON that will arrive in the AM in a near future block. The actual address generation takes a second or so, there is no need to wait 5 minutes<br /><br />I will put this program on my development server, but it has DDOs protection, so it should be OK and it will be the only server in direct contact with the MGW servers.<br /><br />James

As in no running Nxt client or MGW lite extension.<br /><br />What I'm thinking is for people just using multigateway.com to 'purchase' NXT for btc/ltc with only needing access to the website and their other currency wallet. [Obviously they would have needed to run the Nxt client at some point to get a Nxt account to output to.]<br /><br />I'm hoping we can get a 'fund your account' part on nxt.org that goes straight to the mgw in the above fashion, enabling new users to have a very easy method of getting their first NXT, and at the same time hopefully increasing the demand of NXT on the mgw.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Currently I require that the API requests are tokenized, which requires the acct password.<br />However, generating a deposit address is not actually that sensitive because it will always be the same address, given the same set of servers. So, I could remove the tokenization restriction for requesting a deposit address.<br /><br />Now, in that case, all you would need is a way for your (or any) website to generate the AM request for a MGW deposit address and then just submit that to the NXT network. The MGW servers will pick that up and then respond back with the address.<br /><br />So to make things even easier, what if the website had a page to locally generate a password? Then somebody totally fresh to NXT can come to the site, click a button to get a high entropy password (and the corresponding acct #), QR codes are generated so they can take a pic to preserve it. At the same time, the deposit address AM request is sent and the user can get an email with their deposit address(es). From there all they have to do is send from their bitcoin-qt and they can even see that it is in their acct from block explorers.<br /><br />So, the answer is yet, it is quite possible to have a totally web based process, but it requires some web server side software. I dont do that sort of thing, but I would be happy to help whoever you get to implement this!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. There is a little formatting issue for the AM, but once you get ready to implement this, these details are small matters. More difficult is the scanning for the actual addresses. Let me think.... I think the best way is to build this into the pNXTd daemon, then all you would have to do is submit an API request to :7777 with the NXT address you want MGW multisig addresses for. No need to worry about the formatting of AM or scanning of blockchain. Just poll another API request until the address is there.

We have 1 million worth of pNXT and 1 million NXT, plus privateSends temporarily inject more NXT into the system. We can do the &quot;faster than light travel trick&quot; where NXT in one acct is &quot;transferred&quot; to a remote account, just with ledger entry changes, but that requires enough community NXT at the destination. Really what we need is to have both the pNXT and NXT in the privacyServer system to flow freely from wherever it is, to wherever it is needed. It would be like in a closed system with the pNXT on the other side of the barrier and the NXT on this side. As new NXT comes in for privateSend, it temporarily &quot;mixes&quot; with the community NXT as its counterpart pNXT zaps across the network to where it is needed. Now the same amount of NXT needs to come out of the community NXT to complete the cycle.<br /><br />Maybe we need some magic?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So isn't this the way Western Union and other money transfer services are operating...?<br /><br />You give the money + fee in one city and immediatly after they enter the transaction in their system, your money is immediately available at desired destination, where they have office that has enough money for withdrawal...
