This makes me very upset...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am not attacking, just concerned what happens if (when?) this bitshares thing price collapses. It just sounds too much like emunie, which also did not sound like any stable system. Unstable crypto system at large scale, marketed as being stable, is disingenuous at best and harmful to all crypto at worst<br /><br />If they are more honest about this being a grand experiment in holographic market pegging, then we can see if the moon is really made of cheese or not.<br /><br />James

They really need to hire some math and economy experts to validate it.<br /><br />I have three questions:<br />1)The collateral&nbsp; - they use BSTX as the collateral and&nbsp; track the value of BSTX by its price to USD. In real life, the lenders usually use real estates, highly liquid securities, or cash and gold as collaterals. But BSTX as a cypto coin is highly fluctuated. This fluctuation can result in freqent margin call, large amount of uncovered assets, and fail and termination of the short contracts easily and often. The market could be destroyed by this kind “financial crisis”.<br /><br />2)The price of BSTX will depend on the exchanges outside of BSTX system. BTSX will have to decide which price to use and input this exchange rate into BTSX system frequently. This kind action will make BTSX more like centralized bank.&nbsp; <br /><br />3)Regarding the 2x BSTX as margin, will a large portion of BSTX be locked as collateral? Will this create a shortage of BSTX to disrupt the normal market activities?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My prediction is that this whole &quot;experiment&quot; will be used to &quot;prove&quot; that this system works. And as long as the btsx corp has enough funds to support the price, it will &quot;work&quot;<br />However, the more they succeed, the less they will be able to control the price. The bigger they get, the larger the inherent force to the volatility and the more capital they will need.<br />I think the Bank of England tried to support GBP, but ended up making soros a few billions, and still failing to prop it up against the market forces.<br />so, i predict, btsx will perform fantastically well, millions will pour in, until some random event or just natural market cycles convinces a significant percentage of people that margin calls will get triggered. This will then be the event that causes the margin call cascade and at the high enough volume levels, the btsx corp wont be able to stop it. The flash crash happens and btsx corp buys up all the btsx at 90% discount, apologizes, and says we will improve it so this wont ever happen again. We promise<br /><br />James

I think it is such things that are rubbing people the wrong way.<br /><strong>No, First I am not the one saying that, all I said is that bm has unreachably high standards from time to time.<br />Second, I am just saying that you can always find some metric to say this could be better/more decentralized in this case. <br />If you ask about my own opinion both NXT and BTS are decentralized enough for my liking.<br /></strong>I am curious to know what happens to the collateral value when btsx drops 50% in value. With a 50% margin, that would put all pegs undercapitalized. What mechanism is there to prevent a cascade effect that would flash crash the 50% drop to a 90% drop? Is there anything other than relying on the magic hand of the market?<br /><strong>The system is generally handling this&nbsp; the same way any other market (that uses collateral) is handling it. - If the collateral is not enough (is below the call price) this results in margin call&nbsp; and liquidation of the position.<br /></strong><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So you agree with my prediction of flash crash if ever btsx drops below 50% of the price where some significant volume has pegged itself?<br /><br />Now that the panic buying has started, the marketcap can easily get to 100 million and the natural retracement would go below $50 million marketcap and thus the majority of the pegs would be liquidated, creating a cascade of selling not just from fear but by the forced liquidation actually triggering the forced liquidation of pegs that came in at lower prices, and when those get liquidated, etc.<br /><br />So this all appears to be designed to be a volatility enhancer. I really was bored with the +/-10% per day most crypto has, I am glad we now have something that should be doing +/-100%. The key question is if the dead cat bounce will just fade or come back to life?<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. There is apparently no actual fiat backing this or anything else, there is no actual floor, other than the lowball price risk takers are willing to pay after the flash crash. Of course, maybe it will just keep doubling in price forever and in two months all the worlds money will be in btsx <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />
