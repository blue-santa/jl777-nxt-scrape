Then a small correction back to .0001, but if the undershoot from the .00016 peak is .00009 then this could be the last time in a while that we see prices of .0001 as there is enough nervousness that I dont see an overbought condition this time around, so the gain to .000125 will be on a wall of worry.<br /><br />If so, we could gain 10% or so on the floor to .00011<br /><br />Then if the escalator can be put in place, people could enter and exit their NXT positions without having to be market timing wizards. Whenever they wanted they could cashout and buy back in, only losing a few percent to bid/ask spread and the gradually changing tide<br /><br />James

All it would take is one or a few whale(s) (who knows you're doing this) to continuously dump until you're dry...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am not talking about price fixing, but rather just dampening the price movements. Right now, a relatively small order of 100,000 NXT can change the price 10% or more.<br /><br />By putting in 1 million NXT buy and sell at +/- 5% from the market, it allows the market to breathe and trade within a 10% range for the day. Not sure if 5% is the magic number, but something like that.<br /><br />Now, most days the value of NXT will not change by 10%, so anytime the price changes by 10% or more, it is an overreaction or a correction from a cumulative overbought/oversold time period<br /><br />So, if at 5%, 10%, 15% there was 1 million, 2 million and 3 million NXT orders, it would take 6 million NXT to move the price more than 15%. if the whales doing this are pushing the price away from what the actual market price is, then they have just invested 6 million NXT at more than 10% worse than market prices. So, now they have risked almost a million NXT.<br /><br />How will they make it back? If it is a pump, they now need another 6 million NXT to come in above the 15% third wall. Most of the time, the price would come back down and maybe the opposite 5%, 10% and 15% walls will be hit. Instead of losing money, it seems the shark will welcome whale attempts.<br /><br />Notice I am not trying to stop the price from moving up or down, just making it expensive to do so. The attempts to keep the price set to a fixed price is what will always fail when the market price is higher. I need to work out the math a bit to make sure on average, this will generate incremental profits instead of incremental losses.<br /><br />the key to keeping the pump and dumpers away is to not gain or lose more than 10% in a 24hr period. I think that is the trigger, especially if it is the only coin in the top 20 that is green (or red)<br /><br />Help is appreciated to design the proper levels. I think the speculators who want to make a quick BTC will hate this, but if we can significantly lower the beta (volatility) of NXT, it will make it a much more attractive investment vehicle.

It stops manias, at least a little bit. Maybe if the price should really be different, all trading stops, but that is something we cannot enforce.<br /><br />I am envisioning an inverted volume gradient for price points further and further away from the current market price. If there is a big change in value, it can still change by 50% in a week and a half.<br />Anyway, if anybody thinks price stability is a bad thing to attract big long term investors, then you are wrong<br /><br />James

Thats crazy. Maybe people sold when it got overbought, that is natural and expected.<br /><br />75% of the volumes were from the crypto momentum traders. They are always going from coin to coin to coin, putting in money in the coin with the most green on coinmarketcap. At the time, NXT was doubledigit green and the only one in the top 20.<br /><br />If anybody is controlling the crypto pump and dump machine, I will wager quite a large amount that it is not cointropolis. Why would they be working so hard if they already had millions? There have clearly been pump and dumpers in the crypto scene for a while. They are not NXT'ers. They just happened to put NXT in their rotation<br /><br />NXT used to be low volume so the big momentum guys ignored NXT. As soon as it became medium volume and +25% all alone on coinmarketcap, all the fast money came in and went out as the fast followers and last to buy guys bought it all back. The drop in price has been on much, much lower volume. That means whales are not dropping the price.<br /><br />so, please analyze the trade data before believing wild conspiracy theories<br /><br />James

Does two withdraws at once work with mgw?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I did some more testing on the dividend functionality over the last few days. Didn't see any issues except the Nxt distribution overflow error. Although the results of paying out dividends goes to the command window, perhaps it should be returned as html to browser window.<br /><br />For the overflow error--for smaller values of Nxt, it gives some normal values for the first few assets, then the rest of overflow. For larger values of Nxt it gives all overflow. Results are not exactly repeatable though.<br /><br />I can't fully test mode 2 since I don't have an asset to distribute.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It works fine for me, I just tested a 1 billion NXT dividend, which is the max possible. No overflow...<br />Are you by any chance on a 32bit windows? Can you test on a 64bit system?<br />I think the problem is 32bit windows handling of long long, I am making new version that will hopefully work, but not fully understanding the reason I am nervous as I could end up making the same bug elsewhere<br /><br />James

I estimate around 25 million NXT in the several days climb to the peak.<br /><br />total NEM to date &lt;5 million NXT and probably closer to 3.5 million NXT as of the peak.<br /><br />Now 3 to 4 million NXT is certainly quite a lot and would usually be the biggest factor, but there was a perfect storm of events that made NXT the hot crypto and the only thing that can make the volumes go that high are the momentum investors. They buy the crypto that is going up, hop on until it slows down and then off to the next hot crypto. You can see they hopped onto PPC for a while after they jumped off of NXT.<br /><br />I estimate 75%+ of the volumes were external to NXT community during the run up. This means, no single factor had any large significance, other than NXT was the only double digit green in the top 20 for a few days,which attracted the momentum guys. I had estimated a .000125 peak during payexpo and we far exceeded that well in advance of payexpo, so look at the slow moving average on 12 hour chart and you see the steady climb that mostly factors out the big rise and fall. That is the &quot;real&quot; price movement and the fact that we are holding around .0001 without the fast money is indicative that the .000125 price is still on track for this week, with the following pullback to .00011 to .00015. It is like rising tide, you get waves that are far in advance of the tideline, but the tideline keeps creeping up.<br /><br />James

NQT, or nxtQuant, is the temporary name given to 0.00000001 NXT (or 10^-8 in mathematical shorthand).&quot;<br /><br />But still it makes no sense in the data I'm getting.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>for each asset you need to get the number of decimals, for NQT is it 8 decimals<br />What I do is I &quot;calculate&quot; a multiplier based on the number of decimals<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (mult=1,i=7-ap-&gt;decimals; i&gt;=0; i--) // done at init time<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mult *= 10;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ap-&gt;mult = mult;<br /><br />Now you can convert all QNT to satoshis by multiplying: (QNT * ap-&gt;mult)<br />To display in user friendly fashion I have a dstr(x) macro that just does a ((double)(x) / SATOSHIDEN) where SATOSHIDEN is 100000000 so I can use %.8f and the user sees a 1.23456789 number instead of largish scary looking numbers. Note that for assets with less than 8 decimals the least significant digits will always be 0<br /><br />so an asset with 4 decimals will end up with 123450000 -&gt; 1.2345<br /><br />hope that helps. You do need to verify each and every asset handling to make sure the decimals are handled correctly.<br /><br />James

So need to database account &lt;-&gt; addresses (plural) as it is possible to have an arbitrary number of addresses. When an account is specified, any of the addresses can be used as the source of funds.<br /><br />once you have the list of NXT addresses for an account, then all the other calls become possible. Just make sure to iterate through all the addresses every created. <br /><br />listunspent is given a txid and vout, for NXT this makes no sense, so I would map all the NXT addresses for the acct to vout.0, vout.1,... Then if any of the NXT addresses has funds, return non null info for the corresponding vout. I think this is the way to go for mapping vouts to NXT addresses.<br /><br />getbalance now becomes the sum of all NXTaddresses associated with the account<br />getinfo, getblock, getblockhash, gettransaction all have 1:1 mappings, just a horrible headache matching up the NXT info into the bitcoind format<br /><br />listsinceblock becomes a matter of iterating all the blocks since the specified one and using logic similar to getbalance<br /><br />So, this list of commands comes right up to the point of being totally horrible, but not quite. They are not needing anything that actually needs to address the individual txouts, though listunspent comes very close to this. If they start needing to use the output of listunspent to create tx with inputs, then without simulating txout/txin threads on top of NXT accounts where everything is fungible, will yield unpredictable results. As long as they are using listunspent to just get available account balances, it should be OK.<br /><br />Anyway, PM me if you need any help.<br /><br />James<br />
