I assume it was the assets were traded away by the MGW, even though they were listed. <br /><br />What if they were sold? or transferred? Wouldn't the MGW want to send them to the withdrawl account still?<br /><br />BUT on top of this, I'm confused what even happened still. <br /><br />If i had .0167 BTC in my account, and through NXTServices, I withdrew .005, .004, and .003, which then show up in my wallet, as .0048, .0038, and .0028<br /><br />So i withdrew BTC and turned it into BTC? It seemingly made a stop in my NXT account, and there is still some there..<br /><br />OR MAYBE as i think about it..<br /><br />the mgwBTC should have been around .012, and I did see a popup saying I had been transferred that amount, but since its not the amount that is there now, it must have been transferred out, <br /><br /><strong>BUT that still means i only served to move BTC through NXT back to BTC with a .0006 service fee. <br /></strong><br />and the .00467 still in the account, and listed for sale on the AE, must have come from the previous round of testing, <br /><br />check my account, <a href="http://www.nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-T74P-RV3B-5Y8G-6K4HX&amp;c=USD" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nxtreporting.com/?a=NXT-T74P-RV3B-5Y8G-6K4HX&amp;c=USD</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>your assets are still for sale. MGW does not do any trading of assets on your (or anybody else&#039;s) behalf<br /><br />If you dont do a withdraw, MGW wont do anything! Since you have three withdraws to your phone, I think we can assume you did three withdraws. <br /><br />Since there are still assets for sale, I think we can assume those are assets you had over and above what you withdrew<br /><br />looking at <a href="http://www.mynxt.info/blockexplorer/details.php?action=ac&amp;ac=5673499510330659925" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.mynxt.info/blockexplorer/details.php?action=ac&amp;ac=5673499510330659925</a><br /><br />There are three withdraws to address: 1B2EMN2tYx4ht7mQY7qoPR5SMq74LNdssn presumably your phones address?<br /><br />there are other tx also, but if that address is your phone&#039;s address, you seemed to have done it so that is how your phone got the deposits. Since you remember putting up the assets for sale, it is safe to assume that is how they got there<br /><br />the only question is how you had any mgwBTC to put up for sale on AE, but I did manually xfer some to all the accts to match the testnet balance, maybe you had it from then.&nbsp; I could investigate more, but I dont really see any bugs here<br />

The hardcoded limit for switching between forks is 720 blocks, but that's only when a node compares its blockchain to that of the peer it is feeding from currently. It can happen that you talk to a peer on a fork with the common block 700 blocks behind and switch to that one, then see another peer on yet another fork with common block 600 blocks behind and switch to that other one, and overall make more than 720 blocks change, and keep doing that, but the chance of that many forks, with better cumulative difficulty than yours, is really low. And when choosing forks, it is not height but cumulative difficulty that matters - so you can switch to a fork of a lower height than your current height.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Its not very practical to wait for 720 confirmations for MGW.<br />Any advice on how to be able to trust the most recent blocks?<br />For instance, if 100 random nodes all agree on the current height and block, is that good enough to trust that it wont reorganize?<br />

It doesnt, but the NXT core API acts as if it does during a rescan.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Not only during rescan, in the normal fork resolution process blocks are also being popped off and the height does go down (this will continue to happen even after I get rid of rescans). Then, as the blockchain grows again, you will see a different block at the same height - so also don't assume unique height to block id mapping.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Aha! That explains some unexplained behaviors<br />So anything beyond 10 confirmations should be reliable, unless of course there are major network issues<br />Is it common to have 3 blocks popped off? Just trying to optimize resource usage. If 3 pops in a row is super rare vs super common, it affects how much I should rescan the recent blocks<br />

Not sure, just guessing<br />so until chanc3r fed the acct some NXT to get it out of negative balance, no other node would accept the tx that was forged while GLEFU happily forged away ignoring it shouldnt have allowed the tx in the first place<br /><br />This could have happened to any acct that made an AE bid that precisely emptied the account, at least I think it could have happened. Maybe it also needed some other pending tx that reserved some NXT, havent looked in detail, but seems like and edge case and missing error handling in the new AE code<br /><br />Not anything that has been around for a long time<br />
