					Rather than debug a nonstandard condition, I just did a manual transfer. <br /><br />So, please follow the migration path of exchanging the dev MGW BTC asset for the production MGW BTC assets. I will try to manually process anything, but you have to understand it takes hours to switch gears and process old MGW tx. And I am under deadline pressure now so no time for manual MGW stuff<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />James

I really like you and your projects.

We need to transition to the production servers, so I made a special version that will process your deposit and restarting the servers. The fact withdraws processed means they are in sync, so I would be quite surprized if your deposit isnt processed when they catch up<br /><br />James

This thread really shows what James has been saying for a while, that superNET is so much bigger than just him now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am coding 18 to 20 hrs per day, so I am not having any time for product management. So I certainly have no time or desire to micromanage the CPMT. At the high level, I can make the overall budget for the year, but then it should be up to the CPMT how this is allocated and to self-evaluate the CPMT members.<br /><br />Any problem member will be most apparent to the other CPMT members, so we need to rely on the professionalism of the CPMT to handle phasing out lagging members, if that ever happens. Also, as far as adding to the CPMT, it should be up to the CPMT. How the CPMT is managed internally, again up to the CPMT.<br /><br />Now, the community needs to have a way to provide oversight, but not end up micromanaging things. From a practical standpoint, there needs to be some person that is the one to alert the funds committee if there is an issue and to start some sort of process to correct whatever is wrong. Assuming things are going as expected, then no action is needed.<br /><br />I would like to make a monthly transfer of approved funds to a CPMT treasurer who would then disburse internally. To put some controls in place, the treasurer should submit an invoice to the community rep (valarmg?), who would then approve it (or not) and let me know. I make monthly payment. Cycle repeats<br /><br />I would like to have some x2 available for a weekly tipping pool. And I assume there will be some sort of job application process for people who want to join the CPMT.<br /><br />James<br /><br />

Since you're here, and your assets were a primary focus of this particular report, this would be a great time to ask:<br /><br />- What are your reasons for remaining anonymous?<br /><br />- Would you ever consider making your identity known?<br /><br />- What are your thoughts on implementing some of the additional transparency recomendations we outlined in the conclusion of our report?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am not sure how much more transparent I can be. All the accounts are on the blockchain and I have posted which accounts are for which assets, etc. Everybody can see all the transactions for all the public accounts and even my personal one. I have a minority interest in pretty much all the assets, so they are more community owned than &quot;jl777&quot; assets.<br /><br />For SuperNET: <a href="https://nxtforum.org/unity/supernet-funds-request-authorization-thread-official/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nxtforum.org/index.php?topic=5407.0</a> has details on all the expenditures. Is that not transparent enough?<br /><br /><a href="http://104.236.15.119:8086/logs/channels" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://104.236.15.119:8086/logs/channels</a> has slack logs of all the activity. <a href="https://github.com/jl777/libjl777" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://github.com/jl777/libjl777</a> is my development repo with thousands of commits and over 40,000 lines of code I have written. Since my work product is published as I develop it and all the finances are transparent and the community activity is logged, what benefit is there to expose my identity? Does it really matter what my blood type is?<br /><br />Specific threats have been made against me, so I do not feel it wise to disclose my identity. There is a chance that if my identity was known that something bad would happen to me. Is that something worth risking? At the very least it would take up a lot of time dealing with people hassling me, so the downside of disclosing my identity seems to be quite a bit larger than any benefits.<br /><br />If people feel that they need to know my identity before they invest, then they should buy paycoin or many other projects which have fully identified people. In any case, I dont expect to be doing much fund raising in the future as SuperNET has enough funds and once we release revenue generating products, people can continue to not buy SuperNET because I am anonymous, that is their choice.<br /><br />All expenditures are approved by committee and as soon as NXT has the Phasing implemented, we will be putting the SuperNET NXT into a Phased account so I wont have sole access to it. As it is, we felt that the least risk way to safekeep the NXT was for me to retain it.<br /><br />James<br /><br />if you PM me your email, I can send you a slack invite and you can follow all the activity there

Still in someways that was part of the problem that Bitcoin was meant to solve in the first place. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>money supply only has a weak correlation to asset values. just add up the value of all the real estate<br />The link is limited by the velocity of money used for trading, so it is easy for 1 billion NXT to support 10+ billion NXT worth of assets<br /><br />I did not realize the assets surpassed the billion NXT mark already, thats a bit ahead of schedule, but I predicted it would happen. I also predicted the current NXT price bounce, but of course its impossible to predict the market, right?<br /><br />One very critical factor that people seem to overlook is that there are literally hundreds of people involved in the &quot;jl777&quot; assets. I am not majority owner for any of them that I am aware, but I dont track such things in detail. My aim is to get my holdings below 50% and closer to the 20% level, even via indirect ownership. But again, I am not tracking such things so if I am above 50% for an asset, then plz dont flame me.<br /><br />While it is natural for people to personalize all the assets around me, I am just the one that started things and it is the hard work of many many others that is creating this. For example, Pangea, it is becoming quite popular as people are seeing the GUI evolve with the video updates. There are so many projects now and most all of them are running independently from me, though I am always available to help out if needed.<br /><br />People didnt believe me when I say some things, so I demonstrate it. NXT asset marketcap will go to 10 billion NXT and much beyond, I just dont know the timeframe.<br /><br />James<br /><br />

					<span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><strong>[Funding Request]</strong></span><br /><br />Asset name: SuperNETx2<br /><br />I would like to create a SuperNET backed asset that is 1:1 convertible for SuperNET on demand. Additionally, it would receive the previously unallocated 5% SuperNET revshare. By using the 5% of assets for the missed bonus, this 5% revshare will make this asset receive double the SuperNET dividends, so when dividend valuations dominate the pricing, it will be worth 2x SuperNET. With the backing of 1 SuperNET, it is worth at least 1 SuperNET. Market price is expected to fluctuate between 1x and 2x SuperNET pricing and provides a barometer as to the market's sentiment as to how large a part of the market price is based on future dividends. If the market assessment is zero, it will trade at 1x, if the market assessment is that SuperNET dividends are the dominant valuation factor, it will trade very nearly at 2x.<br /><br />This asset will not be dividended out, but rather earned. The v1 dev team is hampered by the need for real world expenses, eg. RL. So if SuperNET is to have a reliable release process, it needs to properly fund such a group. By using a SuperNETx2 asset as payment, it will reduce selling pressure on SuperNET as it is redeemable at 1x, but could be worth up to 2x, so only people who are desperately needing SuperNET to BTC/NXT would ever sell it. I expect there to be an immediate market for this, so people could just directly sell their SuperNETx2 and since the secondary market will most likely be above SuperNET price (otherwise they can just redeem).<br /><br />It is a fine balance required between the decentralized community versus getting a specific product out in a timely fashion. I think the redhat using linux is a good analogy. redhat is using the output of the decentralized linux community, but it itself has to have all the normal structure of a standard organization.<br /><br />The details of how the budget will be used has not been finalized. The timeframe is that it should last for 2015, also that it has the ability to allow for the decentralized community to use a tipping mechanism to allocate part of the budget. This incentivizes tip earning behavior and would be the only way people outside of the product management team is able to earn SuperNETx2.<br /><br />product management members can choose to receive BTC or SuperNETx2 at CMC price for SuperNET at time of payment<br />I am assuming that by the time the 100 BTC runs out (or immediately!), the extra revenues for SuperNETx2 will make it the more desirable form of payment anyway.<br /><br />Assuming SuperNET (or BTC) price goes up significantly, the 40K SuperNETx2 will last longer than 1 year. By the time the SuperNETx2 is fully earned, then we will hopefully have many people who are able to survive based on the dividends they are receiving. <br /><br />The product management team will self-evaluate each other to make sure that everybody is providing the availability and productivity expected. The community will have the ability to suspend overall payouts in the event of, well, I think this is something that is hard to define all the possible triggers as to what is severe enough to warrant such a suspension. So, I think a simple process where anybody can post here that they are wanting to suspend the payouts to the product management team and if they get 4 committee votes, then the payouts are suspended pending review, correction, etc. Specific details on what needs to be done to be determined on a case by case basis, with myself holding some sort of tiebreaking power if there is no consensus that is achieved on the resolution requirements.<br /><br />40803.05 total assets 1:1 redeemable for SuperNET<br />additionally 5% revshare combined with the normal SuperNET revshare to be passed through to holders <br />and 100 BTC allocated for short term payments<br /><br />I would expect a community ratified product management team and budget to be in place before any actual disbursements are made. I have allocated the remainder of the 57 BTC discretionary funds as a bridge payment to keep things on track. The asset would be created and funded as soon as the approvals here are obtained.<br /><br />This is a very important initiative and puts in place a professional management team for the product release cycle, while still retaining the decentralized nature of SuperNET. For now, getting the overall budget approved is the priority to make the compensation real. Then I suggest that the product management team can discuss the details of budgets, personnel, etc. here until there is consensus that is then ratified by the community.<br /><br />I really do not want to have to get bogged down in day to day, or even week to week funds management issues. So once this is approved, I would like to have the committee approve the product management team payouts using a less formal process than 4 votes. Maybe just any committee member can be making the approval, but we honor any dissenting opinion with some civil discussions. The key to me is that I am just making a pre-approved lump sum payment, which then gets distributed as earned. Essentially I would just be providing escrow function for this and when Phasing is available, I plan to just put it all in a Phased account and then I wont even need to be involved in this part at all.<br /><br />James

					What I did was make a lotto API:<br /><br />./BitcoinDarkd SuperNET '{&quot;requestType&quot;:&quot;lotto&quot;,&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;6932037131189568014&quot;,&quot;refacct&quot;:&quot;NXT-PY3K-SDTG-PHTV-GLYDA&quot;,&quot;lottoseed&quot;:&quot;randomguess&quot;,&quot;prizefund&quot;:&quot;175000&quot;}'<br /><br /><br />curl --data-binary '{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;:&quot;curltest&quot;, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;SuperNET&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: [&quot;{\&quot;requestType\&quot;:\&quot;lotto\&quot;,\&quot;refacct\&quot;:\&quot;NXT-PY3K-SDTG-PHTV-GLYDA\&quot;,\&quot;asset\&quot;:\&quot;6932037131189568014\&quot;,\&quot;lottoseed\&quot;:\&quot;randomguess\&quot;,\&quot;prizefund\&quot;:\&quot;175000\&quot;}&quot;]&nbsp; }&#039; -H &#039;content-type: text/plain;&#039; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7778/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:7778/</a><br /><br />The above are two ways to invoke it.

					I deployed a fully automated on-demand DB MGW for BTCD. It will generate a multisig deposit address in realtime and you wont need any NXT to bootstrap an account as the first MGW deposit will be partially converted to NXT as it sets your pubkey.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://jnxt.org/init/?requestType=newbie&amp;pubkey=48513a2d958e4a196b12f0c02fff84855256e455c32a8bac5d3a9f0eec2ce245&amp;NXT=NXT-7F39-MDYL-RT4F-C58Y4&amp;coin=BTCD&amp;convertNXT=10&amp;email=youremail@foo.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://jnxt.org/init/?requestType=newbie&amp;pubkey=48513a2d958e4a196b12f0c02fff84855256e455c32a8bac5d3a9f0eec2ce245&amp;NXT=NXT-7F39-MDYL-RT4F-C58Y4&amp;coin=BTCD&amp;convertNXT=10&amp;email=youremail@foo.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />You do need to put a pubkey and account number in the URL, but if you can use 127.0.0.1:7876/test API page, it is the getAccountId API call. just put in a password and it will print out both the pubkey and NXT addr.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You will get back raw JSON text, but the first part of it will contain your deposit address like &quot;address&quot;: &quot;bMBwHFaGbmAbq9reMcyt7UH5mHtHeatPPu&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />By sending at least 0.1 BTCD to the deposit address, it will fund your account at 100:1 ratio with a 2 NXT fee to cover tx costs. if you change the &quot;convertNXT&quot; field from 10 down to 2, then it will only use 0.04 BTCD. Min deposit is 0.05&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The on-demand part works just by sending the same type of URL but change &quot;newbie&quot; to &quot;status&quot;. When the servers see that there are pending deposits or withdraws and all three are in agreement, it will get processed.&nbsp; This is 4000 lines of &quot;new&quot; code, it used to be closer to 10,000 lines, but I streamlined it and rewrote most of it this month. The big improvements are speed and ability to get status. It is also a specific use-case for a SuperNET application. This is still very new, so any sort of bug is possible, but we need to test it so we can find and fix the bugs. Maybe somebody can make an easy to user form that just submits to the URL. Nothing fancy, but would be nice if there was an easy way to test with half a dozen different MGW.<br /><br />James
