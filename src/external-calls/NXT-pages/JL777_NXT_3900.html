You gain trust over time, only to use that to gain advantage. One the one hand its irrational to assume that all people are so evil, on the other hand especially on the Internet there are just very little adverse effects of bad behavior. So in the end you can't trust no entity/person when it comes to large amounts of money. It's unclear how this will evolve, because for large and sustaining business transaction you need penalties through the legal system. Otherwise certain transactions are impossible (trusting someone with major business secrets, founding a company etc.).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Another reason for multisig, virtual corps,&nbsp; and removing trust from the equation. <br /><br />Sent from my HTC One using Tapatalk<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I figured out how to implement corporate voting using existing NXT features.

Rather than pay thousands (or tens of thousands) of dollars to lawyers to attempt to define each and every possibility (for which jurisdiction by the way?) I think it is much more rational to invoke a person's honor and have them do the right thing. I believe it is impossible to know in advance all the contingencies that need to be covered, and in any case the minute the ink is dry, both sides will do everything they can to take advantage of the other without actually breaking the contract, but bending it as far as they can go.<br /><br />Do we really want to recreate this for NXT?<br /><br />I am showing people by my painful example what the &quot;right thing&quot; is in this sort of circumstance. Maybe I am wrong in the exact details, but I know I am in the right area.<br /><br />The NXT economy needs to be based on HONOR and the community is quite vocal and perceptive as far as what the right thing to do is.<br /><br />In general, take a step back from any personal issues and determine what should happen with the money. Follow the money right? For solving disasters, figure out where the money should go. Then the person whose honor is on the line should make the money flow to where it needs to go. If they fail, then the next person in line of responsibility, etc.<br /><br />It was immediately clear to me that 1 million NXT needed to go back to investors. That was the right thing to do. Not so complicated, didnt need any lawyers or judges or juries to figure this out.<br /><br />James

Case in point, I used the market price of 13 NXT as the makegood price as that was the price right before all this happened. There are people that paid more than that, but I did not makegood for their losses beyond 13 NXT<br /><br />The reason I did the makegood out of my own pocket is that people trusted me to make proper judgements and in this case I failed. It was not an investement that underperformed, but rather a total loss that was due to my trusting someone too much. I learned my lesson that knowing someone's real world identity is pretty useless and I will never make that mistake again.<br /><br />This was not a trading loss. This was a total failure of an asset that I had a part in and since the responsible person refused to do what is right, I stepped in to do the right thing. Not a bail out, but a makegood. Doing the right thing that needed to be done.<br /><br />There are no enforceable laws in crypto assets, so we need to operate based on trust. The trust that people give to me is the most valuable thing, far more than 1 million NXT. I would think that 9 out of 10 people (or more) would feel that a certain someone should have returned 1 million NXT. There is no debate about this is there? So, to me that means that somebody needs to come up with 1 million NXT and since there was nobody else doing that, I took that responsibility.<br /><br />Is this fair, unfair, whatever. It was the right thing to do. I of course had no obligation to do this, but I have said that I will always operate by doing what is right, not by &quot;what I can get away with&quot;. So, moving forward people will be rightly more skeptical about the people I choose to work with, cant blame them at all. But, people can always count on me to do the right thing even if it makes no legal sense.<br /><br />We are creating a new economy, kind of a back to the future thing, where a person's honor means more than anything else. Handshake deals are made and kept. Nothing is more important than a person's honor, at least that is how I feel. Maybe I watched too many Japanese movies as a kid?<br /><br />Now it is a sad thing when some people say that someone doing the right thing is &quot;too good to be true&quot;. This is a direct result of the lawyer dominated societies where the assumption is that everybody will try to do whatever they can get away with and rely on contracts, courts, appeals, juries, etc. to make sure the right things happens. I feel that the legal system is not very efficient and oftentimes fails to do the right thing (by a long margin) and that this is a part of society we need to change.<br /><br />James<br />

					I forgot to mention the best part about NXTprivacy, well this is a NXTmixer concept I had from way back when and it is the idea of private accounts. You register your private account with the privacyServer that you are subscribed to.<br /><br />Now anybody can send NXT (or assets) to your public address, but it will end up in your private account, which nobody other than the privacyServer will know is yours. This means that if you spend funds from your private account, then nobody knows that it is you who is spending it.<br /><br />One use case for all this is:<br />1) send NXT to your own public NXT address -&gt; ends up funding private recv acct.<br />2) send NXT from private account to NXTcard -&gt; now you can buy things online or even withdraw cash from ATM and there is no link to your public NXT address<br /><br />One key point is that the privacyServers wont ever store any of your private account numbers and it certainly wont be on the blockchain. Another key point is that when zerocash (or equivalent) tech becomes open source, it can be used to enhance the privacy level to &quot;Total Privacy&quot;<br /><br />Until then NXTprivacy will have &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;business&quot; level privacy<br /><br />currently privacyServer is expected to provide:<br />1) secure UDP proxy for InstantDEX<br />2) automatic forwarding to private accounts<br />3) managed payment streams to standardize amounts being sent<br />4) unlimited fully encrypted chat and maybe even file transfer<br />5) TBD<br /><br />James<br />

					Now that I have solved some of the privacy issues, it seems like a good time to introduce Privatebet.<br />Privatebet is what is sounds like, it allows you to make bets directly with someone else. For events with publicly verifiable results, there will be a decentralized mechanism for the payouts. You can even create one shot bets based on anything you can think of, but for this you would need to get someone to agree to be your arbiter in case both parties cant agree as to what the result is.<br /><br />The GUI will be integrated into the enhanced NXTservices GUI, so it will be familiar and easy to use.<br /><br />Not sure if the first version can be fully integrated with InstantDEX, but longer term that is the plan so that bets can be made/updated in near realtime<br /><br />James<br /><br />Privatebet acct: NXT-ZGGJ-5G8H-K24Y-3BD8S

					I am still working out the details, but my current thinking is to create a NXTprivacy asset that will hold significant portions of at least two other assets Privatebet (fully decentralized peer to peer betting) and NXTcard (anonymous debit card that can be loaded with NXT -&gt; local fiat)<br /><br />It will also develop privacyServer daemon's for people to run on their unix nodes to earn nodecoins and offer low cost privacy services for users. The goal is for each server to be able to generate enough revenues directly to cover all operating costs so that we never have to worry about not having enough ddos protected servers running NXT core. So the subscribers to the privacy servers will not only be gaining an extra level of privacy, they will also be helping the NXT network itself. It will also allow you to have unlimited encrypted chat with no additional fee over the base subscription price. I am thinking 10 NXT/month for the recommended subscription price, but maybe nodecoins or InstantDEX activity can provide credits against this.<br /><br />What having a privacy server that you trust allows is to utilize a privateNXT asset, which is just a 1:1 equivalent to NXT, but since it is an asset, it has a comment field that can be used to annotate the payments. This in turn allows some clever methods to create additional privacy, especially when it all goes into the same account, even if for just a short time as NXT doesnt have the txout/txin trail going back to genesis account. privateNXT will have a market made in AE with 1% difference from NXT.<br /><br />So, NXTprivacy would pass through any dividends from Privatebet and NXTcard and it will also make the spread on privateNXT. I plan on giving away the privacyServer daemons to help strengthen the NXT network and allow the sometimes underappreciated server guys a way to recoup their costs of running NXT core nodes.<br /><br />MGW provides the security<br />InstantDEX provides the speed<br />NXTprivacy keeps it all private<br /><br />James<br /><br />

Also if things go as planned, NXTprivacy will be the first NXT asset that is both an operating asset and a holding asset as it will most likely issue several assets of its own, each with a unique value proposition. I think Privatebet will also have its own independent availability, so you can choose to invest in NXTprivacy to get the entire range, or just&nbsp; Privatebet. Since Privatebet is a fully decentralized peer to peer betting, it could be very popular.<br /><br />NXTprivacy will be enhancing NXTsync and providing several privacy levels for users of NXTservices, hopefully it can also offer a truly private way to convert NXT to fiat. Still working out some details, but recent events have made personal privacy a much higher priority for myself.<br /><br />So if all goes well, there could be two NXTventure assets available in July, but it could easily slip into August for the second one. By August some of the other things in the pipeline should start becoming ready for sale. The cool thing is that there is a fair amount of tech overlap for all the summer items and now we have NXTservices GUI and MGW getting into shape, things are looking quite good for this summer.<br /><br />James

Once all the bugs are gone, it should run for quite a while anyway.<br />I just fixed the last big open issue (that of blocks being able to be popped off) that confused the MGW in rare cases and caused it to block withdraws.<br />I still want to add realtime NXT network health monitor to the MGW, but that requires getting all the infrastructure for nodecoin in place.<br />still working on it<br />
