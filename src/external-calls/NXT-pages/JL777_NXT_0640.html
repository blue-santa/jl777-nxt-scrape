Though it sound impressive <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /><br />Is that feature added to the NXT coins, or is it a new core with new chain?<br />What is a use-case of this connection thing?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It's a modification of the NRS code base, where you can hook in &quot;listeners&quot; of events. And I agree with you, this is a techy thingie.<br /><br />For example, let's say you are the developer for an exchange that use NXT and you want to know when a new transaction comes in to show it to your customer on your site.<br />Today you'll have to poll the NRS client, asking it every 10-20 seconds with the &quot;getUnconfirmedTransactions&quot; api function, and filtering out transactions that you already know about.<br />With NXT PLUS you can subscribe to the &quot;addedUnconfirmedTransactions&quot; event and the NRS code will, in real time let your code know that a new unconfirmed transaction has arrived.<br /><br />There's lots of technical advantages with the second approach:<br />- You can show the transaction on your site in real time, instead of having to wait x seconds until your next poll.<br />- Not as complex code for you to write when you know that the transaction you recieve is indeed a new transaction and thus no special handling is required.<br /><br />The big benefit comes in when you need to handle blocks, forks, knowing what transactions that got included in the new chain, etc. Those technical advantages you got from using NXT PLUS is really helping you out then.<br /><br />PS. I have nothing to do with this project, I just found out about it yesterday, but these are the advantages I see.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>why polling at 20 seconds?<br />access to localhost is very fast, you can poll multiple times per second without any problems<br />still a push type of interface would have good use cases

I am sure there are people that think like you that are long gone too.<br /><br />There is virtually no marketing for NXT in any traditional sense of the word. The group that releases the features seems to think that the world is going to jump because of new functionality. It is a nice idea in theory but in practice leaves a lot to be desired. Even the finest automobiles in the world with superior features over their competitors require marketing - and lots of it.<br /><br />Marketing is what drives sales in this world. As the old saying goes 'Sell the sizzle and not the steak.' The current approach for NXT is to sell the steak by telling people how long they cooked it and what pan they used. Even worse there seems to be an arrogance in this culture that is rare in the 'real world' of business. In traditional businesses most companies are fighting for their lives and do not think they are vastly superior to their competitors. Humility could be the greatest strength of NXT right now. A humble direct marketing campaign that sells the ecosystem based on <strong><em>what it can do for people</em></strong> would be enough to rapidly increase adoption.<br /><br />People do not care about features but want to know how their lives will be improved by technology. Simplicity in tech always wins. Take a look at huge success like Google for proof.<br /><br />In any event great topic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How much did google spend on advertising and marketing in the early days?

I believe that both parts of this community would benefit from a balance in the effort and capital putten in NXT and not an unbalance as there is now. It's hard to convince the bagholders that this is the way to go and I feel like many simple don't care what way it will end up.<br /><br />If we stay niched like this for a longer period of time, the general public will not jump on our features, rather something new will emerge and copy our features in their technology and this way outperform us on everything we try to settle here. Being it that your here for the tech development or the financial gains, both will benefit from more effort towards marketing than features.<br /><br />If you follow this mindset and approach then what are e currentily doing in order for us to market NXT ? We managed to get some exposure during our pumps yes and that was good, but now the enthousiasm has died down a lot and we are seeing new lows on our market cap. These lows also reflect TRUE interest in our technology. People might say ' wow NXT is great' but when they actually start interacting with it that's the point were they're truely &quot;walking the talk&quot;.<br /><br />A few videos have been posted and some general information is putten out there and this is where it stops. No big plans for merchandising and this makes me sad. Such smart, intelligent people who have such a bad way of looking at the (in my personal opinion) correct way of how bussinesses like NXT actually work.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind walking my talk by actually helping in this marketing if some traction here actually took off ! <br /><br /><br /><br />Restore the balance between the 2 and you restore the general goals of the whole community. Just like life it will eventually fall back in its place, if you like it or not.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>marketing is expensive<br />there is no multimillion dollar corporation behind NXT<br />NXT is not a company,it is an open source project<br /><br />the NXT devs are not marketers, but they write code. <br />if there is to be marketing, the community members that are marketing oriented will have to do it<br /><br />James

The proviso is to make sure the expiration times are matched, so the current deadline being relative to the transaction timestamp and not tied to a block makes for another edge case where we only get part of the trades filled if the block comes right in between the group of transactions.<br /><br />eg. txA deadline 10 timestamp X and txB deadline 10 timestamp Y<br />txA expires X+600 and txB expires Y+600, in seconds! since we have the +/- 15 seconds for the nodes, this alone creates all sorts of edge cases, so I need to use the TF mechanism to estimate the next two blocks and how long it will be and set the deadline to be beyond the second block.<br /><br />which works fine, unless one of the expected large accts doesnt generate the block. If I can just say these transactions expire at a specific block, it avoids all these edge cases and even setting it to be 4 blocks ahead will be less time on average than using a reasonable worst case estimate for the time to make the next two blocks.<br /><br />What I am doing is creating a list of transactions that are needed for a trade to happen. The trade can be assetA &lt;-&gt; assetB, but this is structured now so that assetA -&gt; intermediate -&gt; assetB, and assetB -&gt; intermediate2 -&gt; assetA. If assetA or assetB is NXT itself, it is dramatically simpler, but if it isnt and intermediate != intermediate2 (in amount or what it is), then a balancing payment(s) need to be made, so it becomes quite a big bundle and all of them must be done or somebody will be unhappy.<br /><br />Practically speaking I dont think we will need more than three parties involved in a trade and if a pair of transferAsset can be made atomic, it makes things much, much, much, much, much easier.<br /><br />James<br /><br />

An increased trading activity and deeper orderbooks will ceteris paribus increase the price of NXT.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You're right, but it'll still be less than the sum of all orderbooks. Some people will trade asset for asset, some will trade BTC for asset. So it could [in theory] happen that an NXT asset has $10mln in order book, but 95% of volume is in ASSET/BTC leading to a very small rise in NXT price.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>due to technical reasons, even for asset &lt;-&gt; asset trades you will need to have the equivalent NXT value in your account. also there is some reserves requirement for each conditional transaction.<br /><br />due to this, each active trader will need to have some amount of NXT as a buffer<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are you saying that if I wanted to buy an asset for 10 btc, I would need 10 mgwbtc + 10 btc in nxt??<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />the requirement is for making the NXT AE bid/ask<br />assetA &lt;-&gt; assetB internally as assetA &lt;-&gt; nxt and nxt &lt;-&gt; assetB<br />there is also ~100NXT reserve for a referenced transaction (or maybe it is 1000 NXT), this is $1 USD (or maybe it is $10 USD)<br /><br />I could enable a mode where it is two asset transfers, assetA -&gt; Bob and assetB -&gt; Alice, but this has some exposure as if only one side of the tx is completed, it is not a balanced result and not recommended for any large amounts<br /><br />You could do it in 10 trades and then only 1 BTC worth of NXT is needed as the buffer. Also unless you have another party willing to do the entire 10 BTC trade, the order wont get filled.<br /><br />Remember, this is not a centralized exchange. So each trade needs to be cleared peer to peer.<br /><br />Say you have a&nbsp; 10 BTC size order. Somebody offers to buy 0.1 BTC worth, (or 1 satoshi worth!), clearly it must be rejected. So I have a threshold of 75% of the order size to be met before an offer is accepted. I can make this a settable parameter.<br /><br />Practically speaking, I think it makes sense to have orders of various sizes at around the same price. Of course all of this will be made much easier with Tradebots. For now my focus is to perfect the actual trading and make a practical decentralized exchange<br /><br />James<br />
