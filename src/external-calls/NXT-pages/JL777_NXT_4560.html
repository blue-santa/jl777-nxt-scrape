					I found the BTC stuck bug, restarting servers to verify fix,so MGW will be offline for 15 minutes<br /><br />Once I verify the fix I will look into the deposit address issue<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. The bug was that I never updated the acct addresses for MGW0 and MGW1 and all my testing was with an acct handled by MGW0. By handled, I mean sending out AM, etc. before all three did and that seemed wasteful. This also explains why one third of the accts had no problems and two thirds did

Since that alone is probably a bit more than 1% of GDP, it will be a very good start. The other part is high growth NXT based operating assets, along with a family of mutual fund type of assets to allow people to select whatever field/risk level they are comfortable with.

					cross posting as this is highly relevant:<br /><br />I might be wrong on the exact details as these are guesstimates, but what will happen is pretty clear to me. A NXT asset value will go down if it is an asset that operates outside of NXT, but a NXT asset that is 100% NXT based will scale with NXT, in fact it will act as leveraged NXT. I dont want to get into a debate over this point, but if you think about a NXT business that performs a service and gets paid in NXT, I hope you can see conceptually that the more NXT is worth the more profits that business will generate. Take NXTventure as an example. It invests NXT in operating assets, if NXT is worth a dime, it can invest in small companies. If NXT is worth $10 it can invest in companies 100 times bigger. The profit margins of NXTventure is pretty similar regardless of the value of NXT. So this is one example of a pure play NXT asset. Now as an operating business, NXTventure will be gaining more and more retained earnings and this will allow it to do more and more investments. This is why pure play NXT businesses are leveraged NXT. Assuming the business is small to begin with and it can grow,then clearly it is gaining more than NXT if its profits are not hurt by NXT rising in value.<br /><br />The above is just one example. You might not believe me, but I have many such operating assets that will behave as leveraged NXT. So if we can take the above as a given, the next part will make sense.<br /><br />Let us assume that NXT based business will trade at something like a PE of 10. This is super conservative so hopefully there isnt much debate. In any case you can tweak the exact numbers, that only changes when we hit the critical point.<br />So, how can we possibly get past assets being worth 1 billion NXT? Actually it is reversed, how can we not exceed 1 billion NXT!<br />NXTventure issued a dividend for May that was worth 3.4 million NXT. Let say for the year it will generate total dividends of 25 million NXT. Well, at a PE of 10, NXTventure alone is worth 250 million NXT. I hope you can see my main point, the market cap of assets has little relation to the total amount of NXT that exists.<br /><br />So, now going past 1 billion NXT is not hard, but inevitable.<br /><br />With me so far? Ok, assets tend to trade. Maybe not so much now, but assuming an active community some percentage of the overall assets will trade every day. Let us assume 1% just to make the math easy. so NXTventure will trade 2.5 million NXT per day in the above scenario. No problem you say, there is 1 billion NXT. Well, is there really that much that is liquid and active? The real number is closer to 100 million NXT and it might even be smaller.<br /><br />Lets use 100 million NXT as the active NXT. you say that NXT can be spend over and over in a day, up to 1000 times, but that is theoretical max velocity. In practice, most people put in orders a bit away from the market. I am assuming that on average NXT is locked up for an hour for each trade. This is probably very optimistic as a lot of orders just sit there for days and days, but using the 1 hour and 100 million liquid NXT and assuming 100% of all this trades every hour 24 hours per day,well that seems pretty unrealistic. Have to discount it so that lets say 10% of it circulates like crazy, so we now have 240 million NXT per day of asset trades that is the absolute limit that can be handled.<br /><br />I did make a mistake, the magic number with the above assumptions is 24 billion NXT worth of assets. At this point there is exactly enough NXT to allow the daily trading. Now lets double the market cap of the assets. you say that at this point asset prices will deflate to compensate,but remember the NXT venture example? It really cant unless PE will go from 10 to 5, but that violates our assumptions.<br />Also, there will be assets like silver which have a reference value. When we run out of NXT to conduct trading, NXT will be forced to go up in value and any NXT asset that isnt pure NXT will deflate in price, but the NXT based assets will be like rocks that wont deflate and thus effectively sucks the available liquid NXT way from the deflatable assets.<br /><br />So what will happen is that NXT price will be forced up. Dramatically up, that is the only alternative to people just stopping their trading. But when there is big volatility, trade volumes go up. See, The Anomaly.<br /><br />Now does it matter if the assets are priced in NXT or BTC or goat's milk? Nope! What matters is the total asset market cap, the daily amount traded and the velocity of NXT.<br /><br />So the more asset values inside NXT, the faster we reach The Anomaly and leap past BTC in a day<br /><br />James<br />

I put the odds of this harm happening at a very small probability, so I dont worry much about this scenario. I am usually right about these things, but I am occasionally wrong and will stop harming NXT if I end up inadvertently doing so.<br /><br />NXTservices live on top of the core, so they are technically not part of NXT. Now if 100% of NXT installations have NXTservices, that would be fantastic. I have written NXTservices in C and there is an example NXTservice that just registers and monitors AM traffic. In literally a day any C programmer can get a new NXTservice up and running,as long as what the service does with the AM is code that already exists. I would be happy to host a thread for aspiring NXTservice writers to ask questions, etc.<br /><br />I know something different will happen. I might be wrong on the exact details as these are guesstimates, but what will happen is pretty clear to me. A NXT asset value will go down if it is an asset that operates outside of NXT, but a NXT asset that is 100% NXT based will scale with NXT, in fact it will act as leveraged NXT. I dont want to get into a debate over this point, but if you think about a NXT business that performs a service and gets paid in NXT, I hope you can see conceptually that the more NXT is worth the more profits that business will generate. Take NXTventure as an example. It invests NXT in operating assets, if NXT is worth a dime, it can invest in small companies. If NXT is worth $10 it can invest in companies 100 times bigger. The profit margins of NXTventure is pretty similar regardless of the value of NXT. So this is one example of a pure play NXT asset. Now as an operating business, NXTventure will be gaining more and more retained earnings and this will allow it to do more and more investments. This is why pure play NXT businesses are leveraged NXT. Assuming the business is small to begin with and it can grow,then clearly it is gaining more than NXT if its profits are not hurt by NXT rising in value.<br /><br />The above is just one example. You might not believe me, but I have many such operating assets that will behave as leveraged NXT. So if we can take the above as a given, the next part will make sense.<br /><br />Let us assume that NXT based business will trade at something like a PE of 10. This is super conservative so hopefully there isnt much debate. In any case you can tweak the exact numbers, that only changes when we hit the critical point.<br />So, how can we possibly get past assets being worth 1 billion NXT? Actually it is reversed, how can we not exceed 1 billion NXT!<br />NXTventure issued a dividend for May that was worth 3.4 million NXT. Let say for the year it will generate total dividends of 25 million NXT. Well, at a PE of 10, NXTventure alone is worth 250 million NXT. I hope you can see my main point, the market cap of assets has little relation to the total amount of NXT that exists.<br /><br />So, now going past 1 billion NXT is not hard, but inevitable.<br /><br />With me so far? Ok, assets tend to trade. Maybe not so much now, but assuming an active community some percentage of the overall assets will trade every day. Let us assume 1% just to make the math easy. so NXTventure will trade 2.5 million NXT per day in the above scenario. No problem you say, there is 1 billion NXT. Well, is there really that much that is liquid and active? The real number is closer to 100 million NXT and it might even be smaller.<br /><br />Lets use 100 million NXT as the active NXT. you say that NXT can be spend over and over in a day, up to 1000 times, but that is theoretical max velocity. In practice, most people put in orders a bit away from the market. I am assuming that on average NXT is locked up for an hour for each trade. This is probably very optimistic as a lot of orders just sit there for days and days, but using the 1 hour and 100 million liquid NXT and assuming 100% of all this trades every hour 24 hours per day,well that seems pretty unrealistic. Have to discount it so that lets say 10% of it circulates like crazy, so we now have 240 million NXT per day of asset trades that is the absolute limit that can be handled.<br /><br />I did make a mistake, the magic number with the above assumptions is 24 billion NXT worth of assets. At this point there is exactly enough NXT to allow the daily trading. Now lets double the market cap of the assets. you say that at this point asset prices will deflate to compensate,but remember the NXT venture example? It really cant unless PE will go from 10 to 5, but that violates our assumptions.<br />Also, there will be assets like silver which have a reference value. When we run out of NXT to conduct trading, NXT will be forced to go up in value and any NXT asset that isnt pure NXT will deflate in price, but the NXT based assets will be like rocks that wont deflate and thus effectively sucks the available liquid NXT way from the deflatable assets.<br /><br />So what will happen is that NXT price will be forced up. Dramatically up, that is the only alternative to people just stopping their trading. But when there is big volatility, trade volumes go up. See, The Anomaly.<br /><br />Now does it matter if the assets are priced in NXT or BTC or goat's milk? Nope! What matters is the total asset market cap, the daily amount traded and the velocity of NXT.<br /><br />So the more asset values inside NXT, the faster we reach The Anomaly and leap past BTC in a day<br /><br />James<br /><br />

The service would then send your transaction to the requested address. You could specify transaction splitting if you wanted. The service would randomize when the spends were made so it would be more difficult to match incoming / outgoing NXT.<br /><br />Of course, this is mostly obscurity rather than changing anything in the core system. It of course it would only work if there was a decent amount of volume traveling through it. You should only spend TO/FROM ID's you control. This is mostly providing a method to move NXT/Assets from some public ID you have used to a private one you don't publish. Or, vice versa, you could have a nice private NXT id (private in the sense that the ID can't be related to you), and move NXT from that to various other IDs that you use to spend from.<br /><br />Of course the service would not log and transactions after it has been completed, or IPs.
