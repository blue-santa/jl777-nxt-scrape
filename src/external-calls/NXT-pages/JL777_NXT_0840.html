So if there are a pair of identical machines, maybe it is possible to automatically monitor the coin daemons and switch out the one that is stuck<br /><br />the problem is 24 hour support for 3 independent locations. this is 9 work shifts per day...<br />Now assuming money wasnt an issue and we could hire 24 hour monitoring then... except money is an issue. <br /><br />Also, this area is not really my expertise, so if you are able to devise a way to keep all coin daemon's running 24 hours a day, then please help!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. The new realtime MGW is much easier as it already provides realtime monitoring and is very fast so it does not take long to find out if something is wrong. The old MGW, it is taking some time during restart and so when people are counting minutes there is a disconnect when it is 3am where the server host is.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />jl777, I know this wouldn't be am ideal solution, but maybe it would help.<br />What if you had the servers restart once a night?&nbsp; That way any that are stuck or crashed, would start back up.&nbsp; I wouldn't imagine the downtime would be high to just restart the server and have the coin daemons auto start on bootup.<br /><br />Just a thought to maybe help.&nbsp; Good job with everything<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the problem is the old MGW boot time is needing to rescan the BTC blockchain. And BTC is, well, really really slow<br />so if there is a problem and MGW exits it of course automatically restarts. The BTC blockchain loading is so slow it actually made me write the ramchains!<br /><br />but this latest incident when it ran out of assets (due to 80+ BTC deposit), then there is no automated way to transfer in new assets, at least not till Phasing + Account control.<br /><br />In this case, we identified it, fixed it and it self-corrected in about 12 hours. This sounds horrible, but it always seems to happen just as someone goes off duty and that someone is the exact person needed to fix it. I think this is the fault of Mr. Murphy.<br /><br />The realtime MGW uses ramchains, so restarting that takes just a few minutes and we are making all sorts of alarms and monitors, etc. You have to also realize the old MGW is run on volunteer basis and there are no profits from it, just expenses. It is clear that this is too extreme on the frugality side and that people would rather pay a small fee that would fund 24hr monitoring and faster response time<br /><br />James

And if the downtime is over 24 hours, the delay is become a reduction.<br /><br />Since all three servers need to be in sync, if any of them get any error in any coin daemon, eg. NXT java error loops seem common since MS release, then it needs to be kickstarted.<br /><br />Anyway coordinating three independent server operators is a logistic issue and a solution is being worked on. Now with direct financial consequences for downtime, I am hopeful that the logistics issues will be solved.<br /><br />I apologize for any delays, I was unfortunately recharging after working ~30 hrs straight, so could not help with this until now. <br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>And that is going to work how?<br />I think 2 of your operators aren't on the payroll.<br /><br />You are not going to like what I'm about to say, but MGW was and still isn't production worthy.<br /><br />If I read what the &quot;solutions&quot; to these outages are &quot;restart deamon, restarted server&quot;... Come on, it's been a year now?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I agree that the old MGW is not good for scaling up, why do you think I rewrote it to DB MGW and then rewrote that to be realtime MGW.<br /><br />Did you not understand that BTC is using the 8 month old MGW code? The realtime MGW is totally reengineered.<br /><br />Now if a coin daemon is stuck (we have all seen NXT java error loop), my solution is to restart the coin daemon. Your solution is? Its been a year. I am sorry my productivity is below your expectations. I am sorry that I cannot make software that keeps working when coin daemons stop.<br /><br />Now instead of just doing nothing, what I have done is created liquidity on NXT AE. If you didnt notice bter was hacked and with it majority of NXT trading. Since the ramchain for BTC is still not ready, I used the existing production MGW running the old version.<br /><br />What is your advice? Should I just take down all my quotes on the NXT AE and let NXT volumes shrink away or force people to yet another central exchange?<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />how feasible is it to have paired up servers running simultaneously while in sync with other pairs, so when one fails it will restart while the other one takes over. <br /><br />eg 6 servers instead of the 3 you have now. only it will work as failsafe. <br /><br />eg. servers. AA1BB1CC1<br /><br />So with server problems, it will still work.<br />&nbsp;A <del>A1</del> B B1 <del>C </del>C1<br /><br />A1 is down. restart it before A goes down.<br />C is down. restart it before C1 goes down.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The problem isnt that the server's are crashing due to hardware failure. 90% of the time it is due to one of the coin daemon's going on a fork or just going comatose. So if there are a pair of identical machines, maybe it is possible to automatically monitor the coin daemons and switch out the one that is stuck<br /><br />the problem is 24 hour support for 3 independent locations. this is 9 work shifts per day...<br />Now assuming money wasnt an issue and we could hire 24 hour monitoring then... except money is an issue. <br /><br />Also, this area is not really my expertise, so if you are able to devise a way to keep all coin daemon's running 24 hours a day, then please help!<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. The new realtime MGW is much easier as it already provides realtime monitoring and is very fast so it does not take long to find out if something is wrong. The old MGW, it is taking some time during restart and so when people are counting minutes there is a disconnect when it is 3am where the server host is.

I bet changes you want to make are about multiple-branching forging. With the current state of Nxt network you'll get increase in % of blocks mined(and so fees). And that's the only outcome of short-range attacks. I see no any way to do double-spend without N@S, but N@S isn't possible atm.<br /><br />If you are talking about something different, please provide details, or better code. To say the truth I have some problems trying to understand you. So let's use code as the communication language <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I'm being cryptic about issue #2 because I don't want to reveal the fruits of my work without knowing if there is going to be a bounty and because I want to test if it applies against other coins.<br /><br />But #1 should be easy to understand. Detailed instructions:<br />1) Gather 20% of staking weight and do not forge (yet)<br />2) at block height H send a tx to a victim on the main chain (to be included in block H+1)<br />3) fork to a private chain at block height H. A private chain is a chain that is the same as the main chain until block H but then stops listening to new blocks or new tx. It also stops publishing found blocks<br />4) create a new tx that would conflict with the one in step 2 and put it in your private chain.<br />5) forge your private chain with your 20% weight, ignoring other people's blocks. After your tx has 10 confirmations, and your victim accepted the tx you made in step 2, publish your chain. There is a 1 in 1000 chance that yours will have more cummulative difficulty. In that case, your fork is accepted and you have successfully double spent.<br />6) profit!<br /><br />Of course, this should be optimized so you do step 2 only if you know that you'll succeed.<br /><br />So, not multiple branch forging: only a private branch in parallel to the main chain. It's a short-range attack not directly related to what has been described as N@S.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Would a lease of 35million NXT be enough? If so I can lease to you for this test. Assuming that there is an exploit and a fix, I cannot imagine the community not paying for 200K NXT<br /><br />James

Depending on how much money is at stake, the 5 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 15, etc.<br /><br />The blockchain is like the ocean. From a distance it looks smooth. Up close there are waves and splashes and it is not possible to have 100% consensus initially.<br /><br />Now when there is a hard-fork, this is like a big storm, so what is usually rare becomes very common. Usually if the three MGW servers are running with less than 5 confirms, it is everyday they would be out of sync. At 0 confirm, I would imagine dozens of times per day<br /><br />James

And if the downtime is over 24 hours, the delay is become a reduction.<br /><br />Since all three servers need to be in sync, if any of them get any error in any coin daemon, eg. NXT java error loops seem common since MS release, then it needs to be kickstarted.<br /><br />Anyway coordinating three independent server operators is a logistic issue and a solution is being worked on. Now with direct financial consequences for downtime, I am hopeful that the logistics issues will be solved.<br /><br />I apologize for any delays, I was unfortunately recharging after working ~30 hrs straight, so could not help with this until now. <br /><br />James
