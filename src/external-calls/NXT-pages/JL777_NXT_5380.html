					OK, this time I will give two weeks warning. Maybe somebody wants to make a countdown clock? This next asset will be the profit stream created by a project from a team of prominent NXT community members. I am sure you will recognize some of the names <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />There will only be a very limited amount of assets available at the groundfloor price of 1 NXT. <br />That was not a typo, the starting price will be 1 NXT and there will be a price ladder, so some at 2 NXT, some at 3 NXT, so on.<br /><br />I will leak more info in the following days.<br /><br />James<br /><br />Edit: This will be one of the NXTventure 10% deals, so peoples dont worry I am back to coding!<br />

					I am proud (and happy!) to announce that voldemort628 has joined the NXTventure team.<br /><br />He will be keeping track of the assets on the books for all the various issues.<br /><br />He will also be the mean ogre at the bridge crossing you have to get past before I get involved <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I really need to get back to coding and voldemort628 will provide the buffer between all the people that want to become NXT millionaires and me. Dont get me wrong, I have proven that NXT is quite a bit more than your ordinary crypto. What other first or second gen crypto allows for massive capital value creation? The NXT economy is not a zerosum game, far, far from it. Ideas combine with implementations combine with capital combines with community and literally millions of USD of equity is created in the most efficient way, I believe in the history of, well, money<br /><br />My goal is to help as many qualified people also become NXT millionaires. You do need to be bright and hard working and have skills. It used to be that was nowhere near enough as you also needed access to capital and marketing reach. NXTventure provides all the missing pieces and unlike VC companies NXTventure is not out to squeeze every last penny from the devs. Basically I made NXTventure to be exactly what I wished existed for me as a dev. The guideline for NXTventure is that it will end up with equal percentage of the new issue as the people who are developing the company. usually 40%/40%, the rest is used to sell on the market to recoup the cash investment and what remains is distributed to the NXTventure asset holders.<br /><br />Of course, this being finance, there can be exceptions to the rule. For example if you dont need capital and just want NXTventure to do the AE listing, investor relations, market making we can offer that service for 10% of the assets. We dont charge any upfronts and this will only be possible for high quality teams with high quality concepts. Getting the NXTventure stamp of approval will most certainly increase the market value of the issue by 10%, so again it is a win win deal. For these deals, the assets acquired will be kept within NXTventure and not dividended out since it will probably only be ~5% left after the launch. Almost not a material matter, I just wanted to be clear about it so there is no confusion later. These offerings will not be on a timetable and only be done on a case by case basis.<br /><br />James

Also, NXTautoDAC is keeping 0% of the assets? <br /><br />Pandaisftw<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>NXTautoDAC is not an operating company. It is purely an asset that represents the future revenues. Since profitability is a variable that is sometimes difficult to estimate, it makes it harder to value an asset. By making it revenue based, the only thing that is needed is to estimate the revenues and 75% of that will become the lifetime future cashflows.<br /><br />The operating costs will be primarily labor costs of bluemeanies team, but investors dont have to worry that they will just collect fat salaries and goof off playing computer games (not that that ever happens at real companies). 25% of revenues is what the devs will get. What makes NXTautoDAC unique to my mind is that the vast majority of revenues are setaside for investors.<br /><br />What is the intrinsic value of NXTautoDAC? It is 75% of the sum of all the future autoDAC's revenues. This is where the hard part comes in. We can assume there will be half a dozen to a dozen such autoDACs. Now how much revenue is each one likely to make? What sort of fees can it collect and how often and from how many people?<br /><br />Will each autoDAC be able to generate 100,000 NXT per year in revenues? That seems like a reasonable number to me. ~274 NXT per day per autoDAC. The investment decisions comes down to whether you believe the bluemeanie's team working with me will be able to define, implement and deploy 10 autoDAC's each generating an average of 274 NXT per day. This will add up to 1.2 million NXT per year. No need to take 75% cuz there are only 750000 assets so it is already matched to 1%. So if we apply a PE of 20:1, it gives a predicted value of 24.<br /><br />Curiously, the price ladder is up to 23, so the market is agreeing with this analysis.<br /><br />I agree that this is a brand new market and people dont know all the potential yet. The early investors got a tremendous deal. However, I did post about this offering and anybody could have contacted me to make the ground floor investment. I do realize it all happened so fast, but I cannot help it if there are investors that are so fast! All I can do is continue to find great ideas and people and create an asset that is trackable and marketable.<br /><br />Next time I announce a new issue, I will do the same thing. The first one who comes through with the funds gets the groundfloor deal. In the past it took a day or two before I got the groundfloor funding, so it took me by surprise how fast NXTautoDAC got snapped up. I guess I am not the only one that sees its bright future<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see, so those 750,000 shares on the AE are held and currently sold by NXTventurer? I think the part I may be confused is, where is NXTventurer getting it's cut if all (75%) of the profits of NXTautoDAC are being paid out through NXTautoDAC shares? I assume that it's coming from any unsold shares, correct? So if I invested in NXTventurer, I would be getting a return on NXTautoDAC anyways?<br /><br />Pandaisftw<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The largest asset holders will be bluemeanie and his team. This is critical to the success of a tech company. A lot of VC backed companies squeeze the devs until they are so marginalized most of them move on shortly after IPO. That is not good for investors! We want the devs totally dedicated to maximizing asset value. Think of it as a pay for performance bounty. They only earn proportional to the revenues they generate. I cant think of a more fair deal than that.<br /><br />NXTventure will not get any revenues from NXTautoDAC, all of NXTautoDAC revenues go to devs (25%) and investors (75%)<br /><br />NXTventure will sell off shares this month and then on the ex-dividend time all of NXTautoDAC will be allocated to the NXTventure asset holders. So, NXTventure asset holders can expect a monthly dividend of that months offering. The exact amount depends on how well it was received and I cant control the net cash change. The cash stays in NXTventure as that is the lifeblood of a finance company. Capital * velocity is the power of a finance company, so the quicker the funds are recycled the more it can do. 1 million NXT cycled daily is equivalent to 365 million per year.<br /><br />At the beginning of the month NXTventure's value will drop by the value of the dividend. [fundamental analysts: dont forget to account for NXTventures ownership of itself] Most of the NXTautoDAC will thus be gone from NXTventure at the end of the month. But some will come right back due to NXTventure's self-ownership.<br /><br />NXTventure will be dividending out the bulk of the offering of the month that remains after sales. It will try to gradually increase its cash position by selling a bit more than it invested. Based on the ~20% ownership for itself, after a year it will permanently own ~20% pieces of each of the offerings. I designed NXTventure to have a high dividend rate and potential for massive appreciation. <br /><br />James

You need to assess whether you feel that with cointropolis and justabit out there and all the devs that want to become NXT millionaires, how long will I be able to sustain one IPO per month.<br /><br />I certainly cant maintain the current pace (what was it 5 in three days?), as a lot of them have been in the works for a while. I understand that until we have a pipeline of projects underway that it is impossible to accurately estimate the number of future IPOs, especially since I only want the best quality ones. I think that is the reason the price is at the PE of 1 or 2.<br /><br />James

Also, NXTautoDAC is keeping 0% of the assets? <br /><br />Pandaisftw<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>NXTautoDAC is not an operating company. It is purely an asset that represents the future revenues. Since profitability is a variable that is sometimes difficult to estimate, it makes it harder to value an asset. By making it revenue based, the only thing that is needed is to estimate the revenues and 75% of that will become the lifetime future cashflows.<br /><br />The operating costs will be primarily labor costs of bluemeanies team, but investors dont have to worry that they will just collect fat salaries and goof off playing computer games (not that that ever happens at real companies). 25% of revenues is what the devs will get. What makes NXTautoDAC unique to my mind is that the vast majority of revenues are setaside for investors.<br /><br />What is the intrinsic value of NXTautoDAC? It is 75% of the sum of all the future autoDAC's revenues. This is where the hard part comes in. We can assume there will be half a dozen to a dozen such autoDACs. Now how much revenue is each one likely to make? What sort of fees can it collect and how often and from how many people?<br /><br />Will each autoDAC be able to generate 100,000 NXT per year in revenues? That seems like a reasonable number to me. ~274 NXT per day per autoDAC. The investment decisions comes down to whether you believe the bluemeanie's team working with me will be able to define, implement and deploy 10 autoDAC's each generating an average of 274 NXT per day. This will add up to 1.2 million NXT per year. No need to take 75% cuz there are only 750000 assets so it is already matched to 1%. So if we apply a PE of 20:1, it gives a predicted value of 24.<br /><br />Curiously, the price ladder is up to 23, so the market is agreeing with this analysis.<br /><br />I agree that this is a brand new market and people dont know all the potential yet. The early investors got a tremendous deal. However, I did post about this offering and anybody could have contacted me to make the ground floor investment. I do realize it all happened so fast, but I cannot help it if there are investors that are so fast! All I can do is continue to find great ideas and people and create an asset that is trackable and marketable.<br /><br />Next time I announce a new issue, I will do the same thing. The first one who comes through with the funds gets the groundfloor deal. In the past it took a day or two before I got the groundfloor funding, so it took me by surprise how fast NXTautoDAC got snapped up. I guess I am not the only one that sees its bright future<br /><br />James

You need 1000 DRK, but after I sell half, I will have 10 servers and just enough DRK for each of them. 300 DRK per month is not bad if the 1 DRK per day is actually real, sounds a bit too good to be true<br /><br />James

To be honest, I don't really care &quot;why&quot; but I do assume the same as those above this reply. It's why I bought into DRK in the first place and expected a big rise (or 2 or 3) out of it at some point. I expect a big dip as well (hopefully) and I will buy some more then and ride it up the next spike (after 25th I'm guessing).&nbsp; Then I'll buy more NXT.&nbsp; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>DRK is implementing lots of stuff, they will add ring signatures after master nodes<br />not sure it will drop much<br /><br />James

Can you describe or give a link to what these AutoDACs do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><a href="http://coinwiki.info/en/Decentralized_autonomous_corporation" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://coinwiki.info/en/Decentralized_autonomous_corporation</a> has an overview, but it is not so easy to understand.<br /><br />The general idea is to create a fully automated system that does everything a real world business does. This might sound impossible and it would be for anything that had to do physical actions (well toss in some robots and even that is possible), but there are a class of businesses that can be fully automated.<br /><br />Lets take one of the simpler examples. A bank savings acct. In the real world you have fancy building, a bunch of workers with a bunch of fancy furniture and 0.2% interest rate, yes?<br />But what part of paying interest on a deposit cannot be automated? You deposit money for a period of time and get interest plus principal back. Why would anybody use an autoDAC? Primary reason would be that it is able to pay a higher interest rate as it wont have any significant expenses. Secondarily, it would be more secure since the funds would be secured by blockchain, you would always be able to see your actual funds. You cant actually touch it, so maybe banks wont go completely away.<br /><br />bluemeanie will post more details about what is possible. A lot of the automatable businesses are money oriented, probably because money isnt physical anymore.<br /><br />So, now imagine a half dozen different automated companies providing services for people at a lower cost to them while being more reliable and secure. It is a winning combination. Once deployed, the autoDACs will automatically generate profits. No labor unions, no insurance cost worries, no sick days, etc.<br /><br />Hopefully this gives an idea of the possibilities.<br /><br />James

					Since MGW is now a community gateway, I thought it would be cool if the community wrote the asset descriptions for the coins.<br /><br />Here is your chance to be immortalized. At least your text that will be used for the asset issuance. <br /><br />MGW will be issuing BTC, LTC, DOGE and DRK assets to begin with. You need to describe accurately what the assets are. Maybe all four will use essentially the same text, but there will be different number of decimal points, so there will at least be that difference.<br /><br />I am thinking BTC gets 8 decimal points, LTC and DRK gets 3 decimal points and DOGE gets no fractions<br /><br />Amounts will be rounded down if it isnt exactly matching the decimal resolution, eg. for LTC if you send 1.2345 the .0005 will become a donation to MGW<br /><br />You need to know about all the multisig stuff, no fair asking me questions!<br /><br />I will arbitrarily decide which I like best and award an undetermined amount of MGW to the winner(s)<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. deadline is 12 hours from now
