It went something like this:<br />a) I announce I will destroy NXT by selling it for nothing<br />b) everybody gets so scared they sell me all their NXT for next to nothing<br />c) I then destroy NXT by selling it for nothing thus allowing a &quot;nothing at stake&quot; attack, which would work if NXT didnt cost you anything<br /><br />do you see any flaws with this attack?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Not, if everybody really gets scared and sells <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think the logical fallacy the nothing at stake people get into is that they start with the assumption that PoS currency has no value and therefore it has no value!<br />Actually you can make any sort of elaborate proof that this is true, but it all depends on the critical assumption that it has no value. So that is how they come up with buying all the NXT for nothing, or mine on all chains at once, I dont think they are thinking to pick the right acct and shift the coins there (that would work except for the 1440 block delay), but they are thinking they can simply have zillions of accounts, which basically gets them the same chance to forge as any other account<br /><br />so really all that is possible along this line is what I call a &quot;financial attack&quot;. Instead of reducing the price to zero, any significant financial attack would double, quadruple, tenfold,hundredfold the price. Far from nothing!<br />Just 2.5% of NXT over three days boosted it to .00016<br />2.5%<br /><br />What if someone tried to get 25%?<br />We would see NXT &gt; BTC if they did

And buying a lot of Nxt for that attack would be dumb.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There's an additional piece that you've probably not thought of.&nbsp; In order to &quot;pick a fork to forge on&quot; you'd have to be in control of multiple nodes, and you'd have to understand the <em>completely</em> network topology <em>in real time</em> in order to understand which fork those nodes are on.&nbsp; Moreover, to be <em>effective</em> with your attack you'd also have to be able to put <em>all of your nodes on the same fork</em> and have them successfully forge <em>before</em> the fork is detected and orphaned.&nbsp; It is not trivial.<br /><br />In short: how do you <em>predict</em> a fork, <em>pick</em> it, and then put <em>all of your stake</em> on it?<br /><br />The answer to that question -- if it exists -- addresses the &quot;nothing at stake&quot; problem rather handily.<br /><br />People who insist that PoS has a &quot;nothing at stake&quot; problem assume it is trivial to plop down a few coins on a couple of nodes, cherry-pick network conditions and ruin everyone's day.&nbsp; But those people have not actually tried it, and generally have not thought it through.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Great point!<br />the &quot;nothing at stake&quot; argument (other than its rhyming) is ignoring the probabilities involved, so we can say proof of work is totally defeated by &quot;no time to hash&quot; argument. <br /><br />Basically bitcoin is relying on SHA256 to be a one way function, but I claim that it is not. I have no proof, nothing but a phrase that doesnt even rhyme, but believe me SHA256 has a reversible algo and its just a matter of programming that simple thing into a few CPUs and in no time at all you are generating block after block!<br /><br />Bitcoin is dead and so are all the other SHA256 coins.<br />Amazing isnt it, what sorts of things you can do if you just ignored the probabilities<br /><br />James

This isn't a requeriment, is it? I don't see nxtservices analycing this coins blockchains &quot;was this for previous realeases only?&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;d rather not explain clearly how I do some MGW magics, but if you are brave you can look at the source code to figure out the first part of your question: <a href="https://github.com/jl777/NXTservices" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://github.com/jl777/NXTservices</a><br />just know that somehow MGW knows what is your deposit and what is change and what is unspent and what is spent even though they are all in the same address.<br />hope you understand, premature cloning, its a horrible thing and we must take measures against it<br /><br />There is no need to monitor the bitcoin blockchain, just something some people want to do to verify MGW is not getting out of balance. You wont be able to calculate locally the MGW bitcoin unspent outputs if you dont connect the bitcoin wallet to NXTservices, but thats about all you lose out as I tried to push as much as possible down to the node level so all the MGW balance changes are eventually reflected via AM&#039;s and you get all that without bitcoin wallet connected<br /><br />Now you will not be able to do NXTsubatomic without bitcoind-qt connected to NXTservices but that is for another time

I think the premise of &quot;nothing at stake&quot; is that it rhymes with &quot;proof of stake&quot; so it has to make sense. It seems the assumption is that they can buy an arbitrary amount of NXT for free, so maybe much closer to genesis this would have been an issue, but now it is nonsensical.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What about mining on multiple chains at once?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />@James: why would someone need to make multiple NXT-Accounts? If you can forge with one account on multiple chains (you would have to rewrite the NRS slightly?) then you could easily forge multiple chains.<br /><br />So whats the problem with &quot;nothing at stake&quot;? Is ist that there would be 100000 parallel chains and everybody would forge on each chain to maximize the chance of forging? So that no chain &quot;wins&quot; and no chain would be the longest/official one? That would of course be a problem, because you could never be sure if your transaction is on the right chain and gets confirmed.<br />But i don't know how to solve that... <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>where do these multiple chains come from? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Where are the forks coming from now? Aren't there some forks everyday?<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/general-discussion/price-speculation/msg50412/#msg50412">Quote from: jl777 on June 20, 2014, 04:52:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Doesnt there have to be an acct that is the one that would forge on each chain? Otherwise there is no point to forging on that chain as you would never be the one with the magic number.<br />so, unless I am totally wrong about that (definitely possible with this stuff), it seems to me that you would need to have a NXT acct with at least 1 1440 block's old NXT in it to make it worth forging on that chain<br /><br />If I am right, then each chain costs at least 1 NXT and 1.5 days of waiting. The latter maybe we can ignore, but the former not. Now how many chains in parallel do we need to be forging if each one is funded by 1 NXT? My understanding is millions and millions, so this entire operation is far from nothing at stake.<br /><br />James<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>hmm maybe it's not about taking profit from forging a lot of chains, maybe it's about attacking Nxt. If you yould manage to always have let's say 100 chains, where no chain ever wins, than Nxt would be worthless in my opinion? <br /><br />And even if it costs you 100 Nxt and 1.5 days to start this &quot;attack&quot;, that's not much.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>if you fund this attack with 100 NXT, wouldnt your total forging power for this attack be 100/1billion? Basically your &quot;attack&quot; would be able to delay a NXT block by a minute once every 38 years.<br /><br />Oh my god. I will sell all my NXT now, you made it totally worthless!<br /><br /><br />Edit: you cant just declare,there shall be 100 forks and I will magically be at the front of the forging list for all 100 forks. You have to convince the NXT network that you have a valid fork, that isnt easy to begin with. Now you want to do it 100 times, with the budget of 100 NXT? BCNext was a bit more clever than this, dont you think?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You sound kinda offended, that was not my intention. Not to get me wrong, I love Nxt and really want to support it. I just want to understand this &quot;nothing at stake&quot;-problem and want to know if that would be a real problem.<br /><br />Now i see your point. The attacker wouldn't forge any blocks with such little Nxt. And buying a lot of Nxt for that attack would be dumb.<br /><br />&quot;Convince the network&quot;, hmm, as i'm not good at the technical details about forking, forging and such, i can't say how hard that would be...<br /><br />I think that BCNext was clever, but you know &quot;to err is human&quot; <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I just want to discuss this topic for my own understanding and to clarify if &quot;nothing at stake&quot; could be a problem.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&quot;convince the network&quot; would require lots of NXT or lots of luck<br /><br />the most danger from &quot;nothing at stake&quot; is that it rhymes with &quot;proof of stake&quot;<br />I am serious about that, it is the only explanation why it gets repeated over and over as a credible attack against NXT, as if it is so obvious anybody can instantly tell it kills NXT by the power of its rhyming.<br />to me it is not obvious at all how you can get any sort of parallel forging attack without a lot of NXT and some amount of CPU, but nowadays we can assume CPU power is free, but while NXT was close to free 7 months ago, that is not the case now.<br /><br />I think there was a &quot;scientific&quot; paper written with a similar premise. It went something like this:<br />a) I announce I will destroy NXT by selling it for nothing<br />b) everybody gets so scared they sell me all their NXT for next to nothing<br />c) I then destroy NXT by selling it for nothing thus allowing a &quot;nothing at stake&quot; attack, which would work if NXT didnt cost you anything<br /><br />do you see any flaws with this attack?

The issue will only happen if we encounter a change in MGW server hosts. In that rare event, under some even rarer scenarios that I'd rather not divulge, entirely new set of deposit accts will need to be generated. However, we plan for even this contingency and your deposits will be safe, just dont complain if it takes a day to get found and credited<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If I open NRS, login to specific account, then open Nxt Services, does it associate with the account I logged into now (provide a new deposit address, etc)?&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes, NXTservices has its &quot;active&quot; account and each NXT account must have a different deposit address<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is the BTC deposit address the same for everyone, or specific to my account?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>each set of MGW triplet servers creates a unique multisig deposit address for each different NXT account<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What if I logout of one Nxt account then login to another account with NxtServices open?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>if you are logging/out using different page, then nothing as nothing really happened. It is all an illusion this web GUI <img src="https://nxtforum.org/Smileys/classic/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />If you do this with NXTservices, then it would change its active acct and depending on whether I have disabled the automatic deposit address generation you might get a new deposit address<br /><br />I hope I answered all your questions. Very good ones to be basis of FAQ! [doc writers please take note]<br /><br />James

					Whoever has acct 14984596228986749066<br />you have 8 withdraws of .0004, but only .0028 in the acct, so none of the withdraws are being processed.<br /><br />Not sure this is good or bad, but it has the effect of requiring manual intervention for accts with funny activity<br />so, interesting would be what will happen if you deposit .0004 or .0005<br />will that clear the backlog?
