Maybe it was created for us to create our own currencies and hype and merely have fun playing with NXT?<br /><br />So instead of hoping to find someone that seems completely legit and you KNOW your ROI is there... why couldn't we create a reserveable currency, leave the NXT reserves in an account that anybody is allowed to view... Either forge or lease the account balance and leave all profits from forging or leasing in the reserve, backing the MS currency by even more NXT than is required by the owners of the currency. <br /><br />Keeping all that currency live and active on the network for forging and showing the NXT balance percentage backing up the amount of currency mined.<br />Not only would the currency be naturally worth more because of its backing but if the value of NXT/BTC rises... wouldn't these two factors bring sheer digital demand and value to an MS currency? And possibly NXT altogether?<br /><br />I know I'm reaching here but I also know I'm onto SOMETHING<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Binding &lt;value added something&gt; to an MS coin and combining it with a blockchain backed intrinsic value in NXT will create something that has the higher value of the NXT backing it or &lt;value added something&gt;<br /><br />So this a new unique thing that is possible with MS. Also even though it is inside MS feature set, the crowd funding is another one. I would suggest that a 100% crowdfunding oriented GUI page be made that ignores that it is an MS coin. NXT already has blockchain enforced crowdfunding, but who knows about this?<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. if anybody is up to this crowdfunding GUI, then I would like to see that in the SuperNET GUI, so could offer a bounty for it

None of these are properly launched yet, with the exception of FS, which is still gearing up. I don't know how this compares with other cryptos, but I haven't heard of many similar projects. 1.0 coins aren't really suited to this anyway - what would LTC do?<br />This is the difference between NXT and most other coins. We are looking to grow through meaningful use and adoption, rather than short-term hype. I find it hard to believe that one or more of these initiatives won't succeed in a big way. But admittedly it can be depressing seeing market cap shrinking week after week, and the peg to BTC suggests that none of these initiatives has affected the market yet. There are also still a lot of NXT in big accounts that can make a big difference if the holder wants/needs to dump. That still needs to work its way out of the system too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Do not listen to lunatics in the insane asylum for complex financial analysis<br /><br />My proof: CMC.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimbit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 4,830,225&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 0.043155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111,927,360 RBT *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 315&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.69 %<br /><br />Rimbit is almost half NXT marketcap. Does this mean NXT is only twice as good as rimbit? So using marketcap as any sort of metric for future value is, well, insane.<br /><br />Now we all knew LTC wasnt worth $500 million+. It did last for a long time there, but look at it now and imagine it in 3 years<br />So you need the mindset of a value investor. If the price is low for no fundamental reason, then it is called a bargain.<br /><br />James

They'd still have to buy bitcoin to give to people exiting their system, but as a percentage, it's quite a scam - which is why the bankers use it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The 51% attack (or even 33% attack) is something against the blockchain<br />Once you send the real BTC to an exchange and get a credit at that exchange, then there is ZERO protection from the blockchain for you. However, the exchange itself is protected by the blockchain as they are holding the real bitcoins.<br /><br />But there is NOTHING to prevent an exchange from removing the real bitcoins from the exchange. In fact they are quite proud that they do and put it in cold storage where nobody knows where it is. How convenient. Maybe it is all there, maybe it got converted to a new sports car? Who knows?<br /><br />James

I'm a long time bitcoin investor turned NXT and MAIDSAFE investor. I'm not a math wiz but understand some of the fundamentals somewhat well.&nbsp; I had a discussion about a potential means of counterfeiting bitcoin with a fellow on facebook a few weeks ago and I keep thinking about it. Instead of posting about this on the bitcoin-talk forum where I'd likely just be abused for even bringing it up, I thought I'd share the idea here - honestly I'm hoping for someone to show me that it couldn't happen. so without further ado....<br /><br />There are major players that have been approved by governments to act as exchanges and payment clearing-houses. These organizations process large numbers of transactions and like banks have a lot of currency (in this case bitcoin) that remains on their books all the time. They process transactions between buyers and sellers on their INTERNAL networks faster than bitcoin transactions can occur. Hypothetically they back every transaction with a bitcoin, but they don't use bitcoin for the transaction itself. Instead they use a token that they can move around much faster as it's internal to their service. Only when someone takes bitcoin out of their service (off their servers) do they need to provide a real bitcoin. Most people just use this service like a bank account. So the bitcoin they hold - the vast lot of it, never moves it stays put. If they were able to counterfeit, or were working with those who had such an ability (51% attack), then the counterfeiter could doublespend into this account as a trade for a legit bitcoin. the non-legit bitcoin (the counterfeited one) could remain in this holding account as a 'backing' for the tokens the service provider moves around. So until there is a run on the 'bank' so to speak, those counterfeit coins could remain hidden to the network as they are not processed again.&nbsp; &nbsp;I.e., one of these companies (I won't name names), goes out and buys legit BTC. that they intend to hold as backing for their internal token. They pay full price. They then turn around and sell the real BTC for the fake BTC at maybe half price. they get half their value back and they still have what appears to be BTC in their accounts as backing -giving them legitimacy and much higher profits. The double spender receives 50% of the profit from the trade as well and won't be caught out as the fake coin is never passed along the chain again.<br /><br />There are many assumptions in this hypothesis, one big on is that a 51% attack can happen (that's debatable, but IMO technically feasible). Wondering if there are technical reasons why this could not happen. Do not rule out massive conspiracy here either - when billions of loot are on the line, massive conspiracies happen.<br /><br />Thanks for any feedback.<br /><br />Cheers<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You are speaking of centralized exchanges.<br /><br />They accept crypto and give you an internal credit that you can trade with, but this is not crypto at all. it is just a database entry. As secure as any normal database. There is no need for a 51% attack. Just any employee with access to do a spend to their own wallet and its gone<br /><br />So, you can double spend, triple spend, quadruple spend, whatever. Until everybody tries to withdraw and find out there isnt enough real BTC.<br /><br />Also, the &quot;cold storage&quot; this is a very good reason to make the BTC totally inaccessible. Which also means totally unaccountable. Where are all those coins in cold storage anyway?<br /><br />With MGW, it is displaying realtime balances: <a href="http://jnxt.org/init/?requestType=status&amp;coin=BTCD" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://jnxt.org/init/?requestType=status&amp;coin=BTCD</a><br />At this very moment 2 of the servers are restarting and processing some big files, so their numbers are not up to date, but everybody can see this.<br /><br />Also, by running the MGW software that is part of a standard SuperNET node, anybody can generate the same type of status display direct from the blockchain information. So, while it is distributed and not fully decentralized, it is realtime accountable to anybody that bothers to run a node.<br /><br />James

NXT is already out. I think marketing-wise that is a massive difference to our disadvantage. It depends on how well they deliver to see the outcome.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What if the dreams come true?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think if the Ether dreams come true, it will basically allow copying all Nxt features real quick. Asset Exchange, Monetary system - all kinds of Phasing/Multisig you can imagine. Goods stores with browsers and escrow. All sorts of pegs. Nxt will have a tough time, considering their marketing advantage.<br /><br />But some things people project into Ether can just not become reality for now. Like the internet of things. And it's about 99% likely that for everything they manage, there will be some downsides people don't see yet. It's just how real things work.<br /><br />So yeah, I'm banking on them not living up to expectations. Else I would have sold my NXT. I agree with Ludom: It would be great for crypto as a whole. But they may not even get it done in the first place (unless with unmanageable drawbacks). If I look at it honestly, it's a gamble. But if I'm correct, it will be big boom for Nxt.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>if virtual computing environments are the ultimate solution, then we wouldnt have anything but some system that runs virtual machines. after all, why both with having the actual device if you can just simulate it in a VM?<br /><br />NXT is directly implementing things, eg. native device<br />etherium is going to run everything as a turing thing on the blockchain....<br /><br />OK, so if realtime performance doesnt matter to you, then we can go with the emulated route. However if you really dont want to wait for the next block so that the next steps in the code runs, then maybe NXT will survive the release of etherium<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. full disclosure, I have some NXT but no etherium
