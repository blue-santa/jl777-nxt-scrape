How do you prevent interference from other users of AE? And who is doing that clearing?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the formula for the probability is not finalized yet, but I am leaning toward a proportional ratio like you write, but for a moving window in time. Not sure the timewindow yet, but something 3 to 6 months. Maybe some sort of weighed moving average.<br /><br />narrowcast latency is the direct ping time between the two nodes. broadcast would depend on the route the packet ends up taking. I am using both BTCD and SuperNET networks for the propagation.<br /><br />Each peer will decide locally what node it wants to do a trade with. So barring some user specific filter, there is no need for &quot;authority to decide which came in first&quot; as your node will clearly know which packet it got first. More practically, if an offer comes in that matches a pending offer you have, it will mark that offer as pending and so only one can be pending at a time per offer you have. After a timeout (10 to 20 seconds) if for whatever reason the trade is not finalized, then it goes back into the available pool. Though I just realized I didnt flip this bit yet! Thanks, thats a bug fixed.<br /><br />NXT has a referencedtransaction field for all orders. So I create a set of transactions that are depending on a trigger order. The node that starts the makeoffer2 API contacts the other node(s) about the trade it wants to do (based on existing orderbook entries) and gives them the information needed so the counterparty(s) can create dependent transactions. Once all parties are satisfied that all parts of the trade are acceptable, it is up to the originating node to publish the trigger tx, which when confirmed causes the dependent transactions to confirm.<br /><br />So while technically these transactions are not confirmed until the next block, since all the parties are verifying that everything is properly signed for the proper amounts and it is published to the blockchain, it is just a matter of time for them to be confirmed. It is like after you click on Send Money and it hits the blockchain, the money it is spent. Some extreme edge cases make it possible for some of the dependent transactions to not get confirmed, but since all the parts are marketrate swaps the financial exposure is minimal for these edge cases. With some additional checks I will be able to get the edge cases to be extremely unlikely<br /><br />I choose a clearing price at the median of high bid and low ask on the orderbook and since both sides are adding equal liquidity on both sides, even if there are other orders, it all just clears. Of course if at the very block somebody is submitting an order at the exact same price then it could end up leaving one half of the trade partially filled. For assets with many decimals this would be rare, but for low decimals assets, it is an issue and I think using the older makeoffer method would be required. That doesnt use the AE so there is a small risk that the block generator can be the one you are transacting with, I think for small value trades this is acceptable as I could probably even insure against the small losses.<br /><br />James<br />

BitShares had the same problem at the beginning, they had too many chains / projects under the same BitShares umbrella: PTS, AGS, BTSX, VOTE, DNS . This was creating a lot of confusion even for long term BitShares users, created some divide in the community, and made BitShares very difficult to understand for prospects. It probably cost to BitShares a lot of potential investors. The merger of everything under BTS made it much more simple and now there is no ambiguity what one is referring to when one says &quot;BitShares&quot;. I have the same feeling with SuperNET right now: you really need to dig and read messy threads on multiple forums to start getting an idea of what it's all about, how it works, and how to invest in it. I'm not saying it's a priority but that will need to be addressed.<br /><br />Anyway, I went through the Wiki and am starting to understand how things are working. There are however a lot of things left unanswered in the Wiki, pretty vague or ambiguous and I have a few questions:<br /><br />1) Distribution of InstantDEX asset.<br /><br />There seem to be a contradiction between the announcement thread and the Wiki.<br />The announcement thread says the InstantDEX is distributed between founders but the Wiki gives an &quot;asset distribution&quot; to SuperNET, BTCD (etc.) asset holders like if it was airdropped. So was it airdropped or was it distributed to founders? If it was not aidropped, what are the percentages relating to: distribution of revenues? Then if revenues are distributed to SuperNet asset holders and BTCD holders, then what are InstantDEX asset holders getting as revenue?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://nxtforum.org/instant-transactions/secret-project/msg12761/#msg12761">Quote from: jl777 on April 26, 2014, 02:09:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">InstantDEX will be issued and distributed on launch day, however there will be no official or unofficial IPO. There never was a public investment window to make sure that we avoid any regulatory issues. That being said I cannot control what people do with the InstantDEX they have. I expect that some people might put some up for sale on the AE, especially if there are bids. The only price point for InstantDEX to date is 7.5 NXT per InstantDEX asset.<br /><br />There will be 1,000,000 InstantDEX issued.<br />jl777 30%<br />wesleyh 30%<br />aldrin 20%<br />consultants and advisors 9% (Come-from-Beyond, AdamLevine, fanaticalfishing, chanc3r, joefox, NXTminnow, allwelder)<br />InstantDEX working capital 11%<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Asset distribution<br />InstantDEX revenue flow:<br />SuperNET asset holders 50% NXT core devs 5% Bitcoindark stakers 5% SuperNET core coin communities 20% Overhead and expenses 10% To be determined 10%[2] </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />2) Total supply of InstantDEX and SuperNET<br />Is the total supply of InstantDEX capped to 1M and guaranteed not to be increased in the future?<br />Is the total supply of SuperNET capped to 816061 and guaranteed not to be increased in the future?<br /><br />3) MMatrix nodes<br />According to the wiki &quot;All MMatrix nodes work together, sharing trade offers done by users. however, the ones with the most fees paid get the first shot at choosing which trades to execute and which to pass along to the next, and so forth. &quot;. How is that pecking order enforced? Are higher priority nodes litterally getting the information first and passing it over to next nodes in the list? If that's the case how do you prevent earlier nodes from delaying unreasonnably the transmission of the offers downstream or even dropping the offers? Otherwise how do you coordinate the nodes so that priority can be enforced? Or is every node getting the information and reacting to it at the same time, and priority is enforced at the time of chosing which order gets the fill?<br /><br />4) Trading mechanics<br />The wiki says &quot;If an offer that is too far from current market prices is set, than it will wait in the market marker orderbook until a MMatrix node pics it up.&quot;. This seems to indicate that only a MMatrix node can execute against a user order. Are users not able to take each other's offers? Is the book even actually published publicly or is it publishd only to MMatrix nodes?<br /><br />5) MMatrix node slots<br />The wiki says that there will be 32 to 64 MMatrix node slots altogether. Does that mean that there will be 64 positions, but a new node can still enter by donating more than the aggregated fee paid by the 32th or 64th MMatrix node in the list? Or are the slots somehow reserved?<br />When a node makes it in the list of 32 to 64 MMatrix nodes allowed to participate, is there some minimum time the node is allowed to hold its slot? If not, there will be constant churning for the 32th or 64th place as nodes overbid each other small increments at a time to get back the slot.<br /><br />6) Exchange protocol<br />How is the distributed exchange really working from a protocol point of view? Is there a whitepaper explaining that?<br /><br />7) FinHive<br />Is FinHive trading in the market as well, or are just providing market data and bots? If the market data provided by FinHive public or will it be subscriber based? Is the market data collected by FinHive published publicly, or is some data limited to whitelisted members of the network such as active MMatrix nodes?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Total assets cannot be changed. The InstantDEX asset encapsulates the InstantDEX revshare, which is currently the fees from trades that are completed using the InstantDEX. SuperNET asset encapsulates all the various assets and is beyond the scope of your questions now as you seem most interested in InstantDEX.<br /><br />The MMatrix details are not quite right...<br /><br />A better description would be that users broadcast orders, but also send it to the top ranked MMatrix node. To prevent saturation of the top node, the node selected for narrowcast will be proportional to InstantDEX fees paid.<br /><br />So this means the MMatrix node will get a bit of advanced notice and can choose to start a trade sequence, but if it doesnt all the other nodes will find out pretty quickly. All the trades are peer to peeer. The InstantDEX trades currently are cleared via NXT Asset Exchange. I describe it in some detail here: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=762346.msg10664320#msg10664320" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=762346.msg10664320#msg10664320</a><br /><br />FinHive will provide data subscriptions for its initial revenue stream and then it will also make its own tradebots that users can select to manage an amount under their control. The Tradebots asset is about creating a way for tradebots creators and investors to profit share.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I am currently too busy to be making user documentations, and it seems few people are understanding of all the details.<br /><br />

Worse, I just can't seem to find any relevant information that would explain the projet(s) and I keep running on vague threads full of childish posts. For instance, the announcement thread of <a href="https://nxtforum.org/instant-transactions/secret-project/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">InstantDex</a> has become such a gif and meme orgy it made my smartphone browser run out of memory and when I finally managed ot load it page by page, I felt that I had landed by mistake in 4chan. The instantdex.org website has no information and just shows a nice bull vs bear fight image when you click &quot;read more&quot;. supernet.org just tells you that SuperNET is to cryptocurrency what Internet is to a website, and goes on listing virtues of another bunch of altcoins which may or may not be components of SuperNET and just add to the confusion....<br /><br />Can someone please point me to relevant, well redacted, information that explains what are each of the moving parts namely SuperNET, Multigateway, InstantDEX, BitcoinDark, Atomic and how they relate ot each other and to NXT, NXT AE and the NRS. Also why so many assets and what is the value proposition for each and why make things more complicaated by naming assets with a different name from the project they belong to.<br /><br />Thanks<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><a href="http://wiki.supernet.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://wiki.supernet.org/wiki/Main_Page</a><br /><br />SuperNET is not just one project, so there is no single answer. If everything had the same name it would be far more confusing.<br /><br />James

					After much troubles:<br /><br />6896683649204647244 which triggered all three trades in block 32701 14538633590799539701<br /><br />13096393609126587603 and 4709644894619028652 and 3507227284564623028<br /><br />The first one was a 2.5 NXT fee that acted as a trigger for the other three. One of them was a 2.5 NXT fee for the other acct and the remaining two are NXT AE orders that exactly matched each other, so of course only half got filled as it wasnt in between the bid/ask like it should be.<br /><br />So still a bug with choosing the right price, but this is small matter considering what I have had to deal with so far. It completed as quickly as I&nbsp; posted the curl command on one window and before I could click to the other window, the trade was finalized!<br /><br />Not out of the forest of complications yet, but with the makeoffer2 all legs (and halflegs) are matched NXT AE bid/ask so solving this is 90%.<br /><br />the important thing to note is that with this approach, the worst thing that happens is what happened with this trade, eg. one side gets their half filled and the other side is just posting a bid on the AE. When I fix the price matching bug, this will be a very rare case, but even in such rare cases (block longer than 10 or 20 minutes, evil block generator not accepting your half and then draining their acct, race condition where trigger is executed but some or all dependent tradelegs dont get filled)<br /><br />When I get the jnxt block time predictor then the timing issue will be gone and with both sides essentially instantly negotiating the trade sequence, the evil block generator is the case most likely. However why would a hacker bother with messing with half a trade when it is just a marketrate swap? Especially since the cost is not being able to make any new blocks for almost 2 days and it only works if they have a trade happening for a block they generate.<br /><br />So there are no hostage scenarios that are possible with the timelocks on multisigs or one transfer done without any compensation, and with the worst that can happen being an unmatched halftrade I feel comfortable with this trade clearing. there are cases for assets without decimals where the original makeoffer method is required to achieve effective decimal pricepoints and its advantage is also that it doesnt require any NXT in reserve to conduct the trades. I think I will need to cap the value of such makeoffer trades just to prevent any large exposure to the above rare case and most assets have decimals so this is not a large percentage of assets.<br /><br />Now onto fixing the matched price and debugging the more complicated cases.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. I realized the pricematch &quot;bug&quot; was because I used a hardcoded price from a couple days ago. so this is pilot error, but I should automate the price selection<br />

I'm thinking of SuperNET and InstantDEX (when it appears).<br /><br />So how much traffic can the current network handle? Is there still some length before it becomes saturated and slows down? Will it have to be redesigned into the Nxt 2.0 net (or Nxt 3.0, since Nxt is currently designated crypto 2.0 status)?<br /><br />Or is it sophisticated to handle much, much more traffic than is currently broadcast?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>with current limits ~50 instantDEX trades per minute will saturate the NXT blockchain and also provide ~10% per year income for forging (regardless of account size).<br /><br />Since this wont happen overnight, there will be time to increase the current limits and also activate such things as EC and TF to handle much larger tx loads.<br /><br />I think if NXT is yielding around 10% per year, then this is a very attractive investment. so as the tx volumes go up, we can reduce the txfees to maintain the yield at 10% per year

I have been coding many hours per day.<br />sharkfund owns 10% of InstantDEX, a lot of coinomat, NXTprivacy and of course BTCD.<br /><br />So while I am not trading to increase NAV, I believe getting the components of sharkfund to double in value is the most effective strategy, especially during bear market.<br /><br />People used to calculate NAV and post it, since the positions havent changed that same methods can be used. Not sure exactly what it is, probably around the ask prices. If someone will be posting the NAV, then it would make it easier for me to put bids around NAV. As it is I really dont have any extra time for anything, at least not for couple months<br /><br />James
