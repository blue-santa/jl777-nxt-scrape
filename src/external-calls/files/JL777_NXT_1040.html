There is some meta-data, but it is meaningless, because consensus is the entire challenge of decentralized protocols that require consensus.<br /><br />Off topic note that per the CAP theorem, Bitcoin forsakes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">P</span>artition tolerance in order to achieve <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span>onsistency and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>vailability of consensus. You can think of the other block chain as being another partition. We&#039;ve been discussing these abstract theoretical issues over in the Altcoin Discussion forum in threads such as <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1361602.0">The Ethereum Paradox</a>, <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1319681.0">DECENTRALIZED crypto currency (including Bitcoin) is a delusion (any solutions?)</a>, and <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1183043.0">Satoshi didn&#039;t solve the Byzantine generals problem</a>. Also include some discussions between monsterer, smooth, and myself in my vaporcoin&#039;s thread. So I have the advantage of a few months of discussions about these abstract topics.<br /></div><br />So the issue is not time sequence, but the fact that it is hard to know if the weaker chain put the data in there as part of a consensus or as part of an attack?<br /><br />If that is the issue, I am confused why we care so much about it? The metadata in the altcoin chain refers to the BTC data, so why does it matter who put it there? It either matches the BTC data or it doesnt. If it matches, it creates a verifiable time sequence. If it doesnt match, then it would be ignored. Could you make a simple example that shows how an attacker can bypass the BTC &quot;clock&quot; and double spend?<br /><br />I dont think using bitcoin as the reference clock violates the CAP theorem as it defines the bitcoin data as definitive source of data, so Consistency is achieved, along with availability. [I dont want to get into whether bitcoin itself has done this or that with byzantine whatchamacallits]<br /><br />Maybe to solve the Partition part, the metadata for the altcoin metadata needs to get back into the BTC chain. We are talking about a slow process, but even if it takes a day for all the back and forth, it seems that it isnt impossible. I just dont understand what exactly is needed.<br /><br />Maybe it is like spontaneous creation of life from inert chemicals which is (nearly) impossible [please it is just an example, dont want to get into any creation/evolution debate either!], but once it is there, it is hard to stop it from replication. And kind of hard to deny that it exists. Since we now have bitcoin, maybe building on it allows to achieve the desired result (better altcoin security) without any violation of proven theorems by changing the problem.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. CAP seems to vary from principle, conjecture, to theorem based on exact and precise definitions, I dont know if bitcoin is the exactly same behavior as in the proven CAP theorem, or if a bitcoin + extra is unable to change it to be beyond the confines of what is proven. I dont like to fight against math proofs, but if there is any level of abstraction in the proof then it is usually possible to &quot;work around&quot; it by transforming the problem to a different problem that isnt proven impossible. Since I am not trying to disprove the CAP theorem, but rather create a cross chain security mechanism that isnt covered by the CAP theorem proper</div>

								<div class="post">A side note. <br /><br />By combining each readonly bundle with balances for all the addresses, it will be possible for validating any consecutive number of bundles by iterating through all the tx in each bundle and updating balances.<br /><br />Regardless of where the iterations are started, all paths arriving at the same place will have the identical ledger.<br /><br />Using the method described above, every ledger balance can be verified. Kind of like auditing quarterly/annual financials. Once the books are closed, then only historians need to worry about each tx.<br /><br />With the data so much more compact, the urgency is not as great, but at some point it will be nice to simply accept a set of starting balances for a given bundle along with unspents and sync from there.<br /><br />I am hoping you know a way for these balances of a recent bundle to be trustable without having to replay all the bundles. Maybe using aggregated signature or pederson commitments or &lt;your favorite crypto magic&gt; can prove that the balances of the latest bundle is indeed matching the sum of the changes from all the previous bundles? If that is possible, then the &quot;only&quot; thing that would be needed is a way to know that the contents of a bundle can be trusted.<br /><br />Maybe just a set of hashes that are propagated would be enough for that, but I am sure there are more secure ways. A large amount of processing would be justifiable to create such a ledgerchain that is verifiable.<br /><br />Thanks for all the advices!<br /><br />James</div>

It makes some operations faster, but at a considerable cost.<br /><br />In Bitcoin core reindex spends a fair amount of time rehashing things to check data integrity, because later it is assumed to be true. It could easily be made very fast-- but at the cost of additional indexes. Right now the marginal cost of a full node wallet that supports arbritary key import is about 65GB and rapidly growing. (Pruned vs non-pruned plus txindex).<br /></div><br />Certainly txindex=1 adds overhead, but the method of creating unchanging bundle files each that has hashtables to find everything internally and where all unspents to the same destination are in a linked list, the overhead is contained within each bundle. I dont see why anything has to ever be verified again once it has been verified and put into a read-only file. For the paranoid, a hash of each bundle file could be made and verified before using it.<br /><br />The tracking of the status of unspents is the only global data that needs to be updated and it is a write once for each entry.<br /><br />Over time, an operation might need to scan all bundles, but I just got benchmarks on a 1.4Ghz i5, taking 2.5 milliseconds to scan 1900 bundles (for a coin using 500 block bundles). So it is not very fast, but would be fast enough for most use cases and comparable to RPC overhead where things are serialized with system locks. And this with the ability to find all utxo for any address. Also note the parallel design makes multithreading ideal and speedups using multiple cores would be trivial to do.<br /><br />If even more performance is needed, each speed boosted address can just keep things cached.<br /><br />Without sigs, my data set for txindex=1 is about 25GB uncompressed and 15GB compressed. I am thinking of defaulting to not storing the sigs, as once a spend is validated and the bundle is marked as sigs and inputs verified, I dont see so many cases where the sigs are needed anymore. Certainly not at the cost of doubling the total space.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">If it&#039;s purely local, you could probably always number that way, so long as you had code to fix up the numbering during reorg.<br /></div>What number of blocks is beyond the common sense reorg danger? I know theoretically very long reorgs are possible, but from what I have seen it is not so common for any big reorg. I think by setting a delay of N blocks before creating the most recent bundle, then the odds of having to regenerate that bundle would be very low. Since it takes about a minute to regenerate it, it isnt a giant disaster if it has to, but best to default things to almost never has to do it.<br /><br />Then by keeping the full sized form of the data for N blocks, I think the advantage of compactness is achieved without any negatives [with the caveat that any reorg past the N blocks requires to regenerate the bundle and everything past it], and these are all purely local optimizations.<br /><br />I was wondering if it was possible to get a networkservices bit? That would indicate a node is available for tx based queries for other nodes. Since txindex=1 comes for free I figure it would be a good thing to make available for other nodes, in addition to sharing hashes about the bundles. This would make things not purely local, but it would operate orthogonally to existing peers and just help bootstrap new nodes and lightweight nodes, but it would only be affecting other nodes that have this bit set.

								<div class="post">Blocksonly, very cool and practical.<br /><br />A way to reduce the size of the INV would be to just send the lowest 64bits. Yes I know, the hash collisions, the hash collisions. But the odds of this is quite rare, just have a combined hash of all the txids also. Then a node can find out with pretty good probability if another node knows about a tx it doesnt and if all the tx are in common the combined hash can be used to verify this. In the rare event all the 64bit truncations match, but the combined hash doesnt, then the full txids could be exchanged.<br /><br />A way to avoid the quadratic behavior is for each node to create a network topology map and have a mechanism to route the message to the likely nodes along the likely paths. Before you say, the privacy, the privacy. All this information is already known to the attacker, so what harm for honest nodes to take advantage of the local topology?<br /><br />With a combined push protocol on top of a streamlined pull to fill in the gaps, I think the behavior would reduce from quadratic to something a lot more scalable.<br /><br />In the extreme case of a single node that is connected to all 6000 nodes, it could broadcast a tx to all nodes at once. The problem with this is the redundant packets going to nodes that already have it. A naive approach would be to have a 6000 bit bitmap indicating what nodes have seen a packet and use that for optimizing the packet broadcasting. Clearly this can be abused, but as a starting point to get a tx broadcast with minimal redudancy feels like a good starting point.<br /><br />Then with a protocol similar to the current INV process, the nodes can still verify they have all the tx their peers have, so the broadcast seems like it just seeds that many more peers with the tx and avoids local retransmission between nodes.<br /><br />James<br /><br />P.S. broadcasting would of course point directly at the node that broadcast, so if privacy of that is a concern, then a privacy-centric node would need to have a different node broadcast the tx and make sure the tx gets to that node in a secure way</div>

The hindrance is that <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">decentralized</span></i> block chains have no external reference point. There is no way to enforce that a particular block in one chain came before a block (nor within some # of blocks after a block) on another chain. Block chains are self-referential, and that is precisely why we need CLTV to implement decentralized exchange. <br /></div>OK, so we are in agreement on most everything.<br /><br />I want to better understand the above as it seems the main issue to prevent much stronger security. I apologize if I am asking kindergarten level questions on this, but I dont understand the external reference point impossibility. Please bear with me. I like concrete examples:<br /><br />At noon, BTC block noon_txid appears. This is available to the entire bitcoin p2p network. At first it is a bit vulnerable to a reorg due to any pair of linked blocks would override it. After the next block, it would take 3 blocks to overtake, etc. So after 2 hours, we are past the timestamp variance and also have 10+ blocks protected by zillions of hashes.<br /><br />ALL the altcoin chains can refer to this noon_txid. Let us call it noon_txid_inalt. I am pretty sure this is possible to do. And I am pretty sure that the presence of noon_txid_inalt proves that it came AFTER noon_txid. Please let us ignore odds of sha256 collisions.<br /><br />In my previous post, I said bi-directional. So the BTC blockchain now gets the noon_txid_inalt and puts that into its blockchain (a bit past 2PM). call this the noon_altconfirm txid.<br /><br />I claim that we now know that noon_txid happened before noon_txid_inalt which happened before noon_altconfirm txid. It looks like I can segregate blockchain events on different blockchains into definite categories of time ordering of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;<br /><br />What part of the above is insufficient to satisfy the requirements for the external reference?<br /><br />James</div>

Assuming the sighash code is separate and reused, it shouldn&#039;t increase implementation complexity.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Also, is there a reason that a unique number be used to identify each txid and even output script (address)? To my thinking, after a block is past any chance of being reorganized, then there is a canonical ordering of all blocks, and therefore all tx and vins and vouts. <br /><br />Since each spend currently requires the 32byte txid and vout, mapping this to 4 or 6 bytes creates a lot of space savings. There is a lot of redundancy in the blockchain with each txid potentially being duplicated once for each vout. <br /></div>That could be done-- but there is no need to do so normatively.&nbsp; E.g. Peers could agree to transmit data using these compressed indexes, while still hashing the original values. This has the advantage of having the IDs not change out from under already authored transactions, and making sure that offline devices don&#039;t need access to (or to trust) external index providers.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The other big redundancy are reused addresses, which are actually rmd160 hashes inside spend scripts. Using the canonical ordering of everything, then each rmd160 hash would map to a 32bit index and with the vast majority of scripts being standard a few more bytes can be encoded into a few bits. However, with the coming diaspora of p2sh script proliferation, it could be that address numbering wont be so effective in the future.<br /></div>This would undermine the privacy/fungibility properties of bitcoin as a whole to incentivize parties to reuse addresses. Bitcoin&#039;s privacy strongly depends on non-reuse, and additional pressure against it for the benefit of saving&nbsp; on the order 12 bytes per txout doesn&#039;t sound like a win-- especially as it would be used to justify bad software, bad businesses practices, and bad public policy that force users to reuse.&nbsp; Access to those indexes would have to be handled quite carefully since if you paid the wrong one the funds would be stolen.<br /><br />Thanks for your thoughts!<br /></div>I used to think BTC blockchains&#039; exponential growth was a big problem. Then I realized I could distill it to one quarter the size and also sync in parallel at bandwidth speeds. Now I dont worry about blockchain bloat so much.<br /><br />I think we have to admit that a large part of the BTC blockchain has been deanonymized. And until new methods like CT are adopted, this will only get worse.<br /><br />So rather than fight a losing battle, why not accept that there are people that dont care much about privacy and convenience is more important. In fact they might be required to be public. The canonical encoding allows to encode the existing blockchain and future public blockchain at much better than any other method as it ends up as high entropy compressed 32bit numbers, vs 32byte txid + vout. The savings is much more than 12 bytes, it takes only 6 bytes to encode an unspent, so closer to 30 bytes. A lot of bitcoin processing is slow due to a variety of reasons. Being able to do computations via standard integers allows for an order of magnitude faster operations in many cases. I think the usage of a DB is the cause of most of the slowdown. Since the blockchain mostly never changes, there is no need for using ACID compliant DB operations for everything. With my design all nodes are doing txindex=1 and it takes very little time to &quot;rescan&quot; a new privkey as everything already has the tx already in linked lists and hash tables.<br /><br />The assumption is that each node is maintaining the canonical indexes, otherwise trust is required. With that assumption, this indexing system can be viewed as a highly efficient lossless codec, so not sure why you consider it bad software. I assume you dont consider using gzip a bad practice? I try hard to preserve compatibility with the existing bitcoin core. What I describe does not change the network protocol at all, that is a separate post <img src="https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /><br /><br />I am not advocating to change the signed tx to be based on 32 bit numbers! All I recommend is to encode them internally (when beyond the practical chance of being reorged) as 32 bits. All nodes will end up with the same numbering. However, all external interactions continue with the fully expanded form, else it wouldnt be compatible at all. All bundles and subsets of bundles would have verifiable hashes and this will create an efficient encoding for permanent archival storage, with arguably isomorphic behavior to the current raw blockchain inside a DB. The tx that are signed and verified are of course using the fully expanded form. However, if you just want to explore the blockchain, nobody really cares about the exact txid, just that funds went from A to B.<br /><br />These are not just thoughts, but description of a working system that syncs entire blockchain and creates the above data structures in about half hour if you have enough bandwidth and 8 cores. It is bandwidth limited, so for a slow home connection of 20mbps, it takes 6hrs for full sync. I am currently debugging the unspents handling, but the rest is basically working and just needs validation. And this part is derived from MGW which has been in service for a couple years.<br /><br />I wanted to use the standard bitcoin RPC test suite and I assume what is in the repo is the most complete set? Is there some bruteforce RPC tester that will use large parts of the RPC that can be used as a validation step for new implementation of bitcoin core?<br /><br />James</div>

Does this mean that PoS coins are more secure as atomic altcoins than PoW?<br /></div><br />Unlike hashrate (electricity), stake only has to be purchased once and attack forever, so therefor rental prices for stake should be much lower (since stake costs less than hashrate).<br /></div><br />&quot;stake costs less than hashrate&quot; this appears to be the same as saying donuts cost less than springs.<br /><br />Sometimes the stake required to attack will cost more than hashrate and vice versa. So it all depends on the specific coins being talked about.<br /></div><br />I am making a mathematical asymptotic argument similar conceptually to the arguments about Big O and Big Theta computational complexity classes (wherein at any particular/small values the conclusion might be opposite of the asymptotic reality). The point is mathematical structure in that stake only has to be purchased once, whereas electricity has to be paid continuously. Thus in terms of mathematical structure (all other variables the same, e.g. market cap, etc), then hashrate will be structurally more expensive than stake. Stake is not as secure as hashrate because stake is paid once for an eternal attack and hashrate must be paid continuously else the attack ends (is finite in duration). In short, stake enables an infinite duration attack (at no extra cost) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thus stake is free</span> and hashrate is finite and thus it is not free. If you don&#039;t believe that, then just consider that one can short a PoS coin (thus recovering the cost of the stake making it less than free) and the market is likely to sell off the coin during any stake-based attack because the market understands the only way to overcome the attack is to fork the coin. Whereas with PoW, the market may ignore the attack because it will be ephemeral unless the attacker can profit from the attack enough to pay for the ongoing cost of the electricity.<br /><br />This is the fundamental reason that PoS is not secure. Apparently <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1319681.msg13488432#msg13488432">some PoS coins have been attacked with stake</a>, and the common case are the exchanges which control huge amounts of stake.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951.msg14002758#msg14002758">Quote from: jl777 on February 25, 2016, 08:21:06 AM</a></div><div class="quote">And I am not thinking it is so easy to cause deep reorgs at will. It could be that the DE for low security coins needs to be done over longer periods of time and in small increments, ie overlapped micropayment channels.<br /></div><br />I presume I did not adequately explain the economic argument. The point is that once you incentivize profitable PoW attacks, the attacker can now sustain an attack indefinitely (or the DE is abandoned). Thus there is no longer period of time which is sufficient (from a mathematical structural perspective, although there might be particular cases that are secure, you can&#039;t state them with equations that enable reliable decisions). I understand you want to find some reasonable middle ground, but I presume you would play with fire if you pursued this similar to those who argued that PoS was an acceptable middle ground (yet even today we see that Bitshares&#039; DPOS is probably controlled by a few exchanges and I think someone told me Nxt is controlled by a dictator).<br /><br />I comprehend and am aware of the stance that says nothing is perfect and choose some practical middle ground. But I argue we can do better than some muddled middle ground where for example Bitcoin is already controlled by a Chinese mining cartel that has 65% of the hashrate and is provably lying about the Great Firewall of China being a hindrance for them (their motivation is obviously to make higher profits with higher transaction fees by constraining block size). This outcome <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=340686.0">I predicted in 2013</a>, even I nailed <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=340686.msg3681159#msg3681159">in 2013 the block size as the specific failure mode</a>, and everyone was <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=336350.0">arguing at that time that I was loony</a>. Their % of the hashrate will increase on the next block reward halving this year, because the marginally profitable miners are the first to go (and I suspect the Chinese mining cartel is getting subsidized electricity with political connections/corruption).<br /><br />You can make the reasonable argument that the insecurity of the proposed cut &amp; choose algorithm only impacts those altcoins without CLTV and thus it is better than no DE for those coins. In that case, maybe I can agree with that. But do fully acknowledge the Pandora&#039;s box security threat so enabled (but at least isolated to those who trade for those altcoins). Thus I don&#039;t think it will be a very popular case, if proper disclosures are made. Who would trade BTC for an altcoin where they might lose their funds due to an attack (particularly even a long-range lie-in-wait attack) and where the developers of that altcoin are unable to add the CLTV op code.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951.msg14002758#msg14002758">Quote from: jl777 on February 25, 2016, 08:21:06 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I am not conviced by general statements, especially when they have counterexamples that prove they are incorrect.

Without a reference point, nothing can be proven about crypto currency (e.g. double-spends can&#039;t be prevented, etc), thus the requirement for a reference point is essential (even Satoshi&#039;s PoW suffers from the fact that it is probabilistic and <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1183043.msg13823607#msg13823607">didn&#039;t solve the Byzantine General&#039;s Problem</a> because it can&#039;t identify an attack from a non-attack because the longest chain rule is self-referential). I can make such a general statement and be 100% certain there is no possible exception, because it is a fundamental inviolable mathematical structural issue.<br /><br />The reference points are provided by my upthread &quot;Coin Days Destroyed&quot; suggestion a few days ago and the point yesterday in this thread about hard-coding the destination addresses in the CLTV.

I know that if I just say, sure in theory it wont work and dont push for a solution, then it would limit things to BTC &lt;-&gt; LTC and gradually more and more, so at worst it is a slow process, but we dont have to outrun the bear, we just need to be more secure than a CE.<br /></div><br />There is a distinction between theory and inviolable mathematical structure. I will give you another example that I learned when I started to teach myself cryptography over the past 3 years. That is zero knowledge proofs are impossible without an asymmetric trap door function, i.e. they can&#039;t be done with hash functions. That is not theory. It is an inviolable fact due to the mathematical structure.<br /></div>I think if the user can set the timeout values they can decide to accept the risk of blockchain reorg&#039;ed after the swap. NXT PoS limits any reorgs to 720 blocks, so for NXT if the timeout is set above 720 blocks, then it will be beyond the reach of any attack. Couldnt any coin use data from the BTC blockchain from some hours in the past to create a backstop from massive reorg? By using the massive PoW of BTC, a PoS or weaker PoW would get an externally verifiable reference? Why couldnt that be used as the generative essence you say is required?<br /><br />And if BTC data from recent past is good enough for a generative essence from infinite depth reorgs, then if a timeout is set to be past that, dont we have the finite time from attacks (PoW and PoS) and avoid the mathematical apocalypse you write about above. And so, if the DE submitted OP_RETURN data into all the supported altcoins with data from BTC, wouldnt all such chains get a backstop? Considering you said it was impossible on multiple occasions, there must be some basic error with the above. Just like there are external factors that need to be considered for attacks, there can be external factors that can be injected into the defense.<br /><br />So, let us assume we have a bi-directional generative essences of protection. The altcoin chains put into their blockchain data from BTC blockchain of recent past (-2hrs?) and the BTC blockchain in turn puts altcoin data into its blockchain. OP_RETURN can be used on all to put a hash or two in all chains. This creates a supernetwork of interlinked blockchains, doesnt it? With all of them backstopped by BTC making it the foundation technically for all the blockchains.<br /><br />But maybe I misunderstood your objection and the above has a fatal flaw?<br /><br />My analysis is that the DE allows people to trade without using a third party escrow (CE function) and this is more decentralizing as the funds are now mostly in peoples wallets instead of a big giant pile in Big Vern&#039;s accounts. So if you are claiming that DE is bad, then I think you need to consider that a CE centralized trading funds across ALL the coins that are traded at once.<br /><br />With DE, let us accept your assertion that it will allow some attacker to reorg any chain at will to any depth, as I am sure I couldnt have solved an impossible problem with this post vs. the practical cost of setting it up. Even with this point asserted, I claim that DE provides a better environment as an attack event affects just that one coin, not ALL coins at the DE.<br /><br />So unless the existing situation of aggregated CE dependency is better for altcoins without CLTV, the DE is an improvement. AND much more importantly, if an altcoin starts trading using the DE, this provides a much stronger impetus for them to add CLTV as compared to the possibility of trading on the DE.<br /><br />My analysis incorporates the big picture that includes getting altcoins to upgrade. As for the coins without dev teams... At least they can keep trading via DE even after all the CE get hacked to bits or discontinue them.<br /><br />Doesnt the DE thus improve the situation for the altcoins? From the BTC maximalist point of view, if a lagging altcoin gets out of favor since it is continually attacked, then the DE acts as a spur to evolve. But primarily the DE reduces the concentration of deposits in the CE and gives people more options.<br /><br />James</div>

								<div class="post">I am no cryptographer, just a C coder that calls the cool functions in creative ways, so I cant speak to all the deeper maths, but if there is a way to allow bitcoin to have arbitrary sized anon-sets participate in a transaction, then that would be fantastic.<br /><br />With IP privacy compromised, then an attacker would be able to correlate a lot more, but if there is an offchain DCnet to create a shared transaction, I think it will be possible to have a zero knowledge protected IP privacy that feeds into group signatures like above to provide a provably secure method of crypto payments even assuming all IP traffic is fully monitored.<br /><br />Once IP privacy can be assured, then nodes can randomly choose peers and crunch away at making the joint transaction without worry of leaking information to an attacker in the group. Even if the computation required is 1000x more, it wont bother the nodes that value privacy. Maybe there is a way for the group transaction to solve for a &quot;zero&quot; or some other special case value to make the verification much faster?<br /><br />An implementation idea would be to assume that SIGHASH_ALL is used for all these, it seems that other SIGHASH modes are rarely used and not sure it makes sense to support them for radically new usecases.<br /><br />Also, is there a reason that a unique number be used to identify each txid and even output script (address)? To my thinking, after a block is past any chance of being reorganized, then there is a canonical ordering of all blocks, and therefore all tx and vins and vouts. <br /><br />Since each spend currently requires the 32byte txid and vout, mapping this to 4 or 6 bytes creates a lot of space savings. There is a lot of redundancy in the blockchain with each txid potentially being duplicated once for each vout. <br /><br />The other big redundancy are reused addresses, which are actually rmd160 hashes inside spend scripts. Using the canonical ordering of everything, then each rmd160 hash would map to a 32bit index and with the vast majority of scripts being standard a few more bytes can be encoded into a few bits. However, with the coming diaspora of p2sh script proliferation, it could be that address numbering wont be so effective in the future.<br /><br />I am getting more than a 50% size reduction in the blockchain using the canonical numbering method, but I still need to add the raw sigs. The actual data is actually significantly smaller, but I wanted an &quot;instant-on&quot; feature so there is no need to verify the vast majority of the blockchain on each restart. So there is a fair amount of space used for bloom filters and hashtables, but still it all adds up to less than half the size.<br /><br />However, when it is compressed it shrinks to about half the size, so I end up with a squashfs volume, around 15GB now. During the parallel sync, I create a write once data set for each bundle of 2000 blocks into read-only files that are memory mapped data structures. Once created, it never changes and has enough data to directly implement the bitcoin RPC. Without an additional layer that creates a global search, the rpc calls might have to query all 200 bundles, however scanning backwards tends to find things much quicker than the &quot;expected&quot; N/2 bundles and all the lookups in each bundle uses constant time hash tables, so the overhead in the worst case is typically less than RPC overhead.<br /><br />The only part that is ever changing it is the utxo set and I have it taking 6 bytes per vout, but this is quite inefficient as most vouts get spent and only the unspents have the data. I guess I will need to make a 50% full hashtable which would get close to constant time performance at a cost of 12 bytes per utxo. Almost small enough now to fit inside the CPU&#039;s cache.<br /><br />With about 200+ million high entropy 72 byte sigs, that seems to double the total required size to 30GB. So anything that allows for encoding sigs, will allow for much smaller sizes for full copies of the blockchain.<br /><br />James</div>

I didn&#039;t think that was the case.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see any reason why you couldn&#039;t verify the signatures out of blockchain order.<br /></div>The sigs themselves can be verified out of order, but verifying the entire transaction cannot. The inputs of a transaction reference an output of a previous transaction and to verify that an input correctly spends the output, that output needs to be known so that its script can be combined with the input script to verify that input.<br /></div>Pretty close.<br />For SIGHASH_ALL this is exactly the case as each signature is based on the modified transaction that is composed of the entire transaction, plus the output script for the vin substituted in for the input script, with the other blanked out. Yes, it is creating the big headaches. The wiki explains this.<br /><br />Now yes, you can verify that the signature is correct and if you have the corresponding output you can even verify that it is validly signed. However, without the complete blockchain preceding it, you can be sure it is already spent. So it only would be a sig valid for that sig and not a tx is valid.<br /><br />This would create even more partial states to track and things are already pretty complicated and I dont feel it makes sense to add such extra tracking for the incremental overlapping. In fact, it could end up slowing things down as things are already pretty close to saturating both the bandwidth and CPU usage, so additional computing offsets the usage of the idle CPU time (assumes we can use all available CPU without detriment).<br /><br />The sigs that could be verifified without the rest would be the SIGHASH_SINGLE, but that is still a partial verification and it is so little used, it can be ignored in overall throughput calculations.<br /><br />When performance optimizing, it is important to always keep the overall goal in mind and not zoom in on specific tasks that are &quot;obviously&quot; needing to be done. At full speed parallel sync, things like context switching from system calls have significant impact, so things behave in &quot;illogical&quot; ways. Just going to onetime memory allocation and reusing the buffers got a 30% performance boost.<br /><br />Everything affects everything else as they are all sharing the same bandwidth, CPU and especially the HDD. A random seek pattern even just a few per second is all it takes to kill HDD bandwidth an order of magnitude.<br /><br />James</div>

So there was a positive outcome from this thread. I am happy that DE can work.<br /></div>Yes scrutiny leads to progress.<br /><br />&quot;stake costs less than hashrate&quot; this appears to be the same as saying donuts cost less than springs.<br /><br />Sometimes the stake required to attack will cost more than hashrate and vice versa. So it all depends on the specific coins being talked about.<br /><br />And I am not thinking it is so easy to cause deep reorgs at will. It could be that the DE for low security coins needs to be done over longer periods of time and in small increments, ie overlapped micropayment channels.<br /><br />I am not conviced by general statements, especially when they have counterexamples that prove they are incorrect. I can easily name many PoS coins that are more expensive to obtain stake enough to attack against a set of PoW coins whose hashrate is lower.<br /><br />Sorry, general scare statements dont work on me. Only specific failure cases, which can then be generalized and solutions usually devised. I know that if I just say, sure in theory it wont work and dont push for a solution, then it would limit things to BTC &lt;-&gt; LTC and gradually more and more, so at worst it is a slow process, but we dont have to outrun the bear, we just need to be more secure than a CE.<br /><br />James</div>

At that point Bob doesn&#039;t have Alice&#039;s private key, and Alice never releases this private key, thus only she can sign back her transaction to herself.<br /><br />Whereas if Bob issues the reciprocal payment to Alice in step #4, Alice releases her private key (so she can claim Bob&#039;s payment from step #4) then Bob can sign using his private key (which remains private until he issues the refund for his deposit) to spend Alice&#039;s payment from step #3.<br /><br />But the problem remains that when private keys are revealed, then anyone can spend the payment from Alice. One might argue that Bob will wait to refund the deposit until after the payment from Alice to Bob has been confirmed spent by Bob, but an attacker with sufficient hashrate can revert the order of the transactions and steal Bob&#039;s payment. Remember you are proposing to have many of these DE transactions occurring simultaneously and you are thus incentivizing someone to attack the block chain with hashrate to steal value. Normally even a 51% attacker can&#039;t steal someone else&#039;s coins (only double-spend their own coins), yet you are proposing to open a new attack vector funding 51% attacks with other people&#039;s coins! That is a non-starter, because it weakens the entire coin&#039;s security (because adds a new source of funding for 51% attacks). Perhaps you have just identified a reason that multi-sig transactions should always have their destination address hard-coded. I think you&#039;ve identified a security hole in the current OP code for multi-sig.<br /><br />Even if it were possible to structure a Bitcoin transaction such that Bob signs for his refund instead of releasing the private key, that wouldn&#039;t help you, because then Alice couldn&#039;t refund herself when Bob fails to do step #4.<br /><br />As I wrote many moons ago in this thread, there is simply no way to do DE unless both block chains support CLTV.

General statements are fine, but I cannot make any specific response. You say you are convinced it cant work in general, I say I think it can. OK, so no need to be opinion based, when there is a FSM with specific scripts<br /><br />let us use the following as a reference to make sure we are speaking of the same states:<br /><br />###<br />This is atomic and it is recoverable if either party refuses to complete a step.<br /><br />1) Either party refuses to perform cut-and-choose.<br /><br />Nothing has been sent to either chain, so no harm done.<br /><br />2) Bob refuses to pay deposit.<br /><br />Nothing has been sent to either chain, so no harm done.<br /><br />3) Alice refuses to bail-in.<br /><br />Bob reclaims his D after 2 days. <br />Releasing bob_priv_n has no effect since there was no bail-in by Alice, so the key is never used.<br /><br />4) Bob refuses to bail-in<br /><br />If Bob reclaims his deposit, then Alice will have both private keys and can reclaim her bail-in.<br /><br />If Bob fails to claim his deposit, then Alice gets that as compensation instead of her bail-in.&nbsp; In that case, Bob loses his deposit and can&#039;t claim the altcoins.&nbsp; This means he should reclaim his output.<br /><br />5) Alice refuses to claim her Bitcoins<br /><br />1 day later Bob can reclaim his Bitcoins<br /><br />Alice gets her altcoins back or she gets D instead (if Bob doesn&#039;t reclaim his deposit).<br /><br />6) Bob refuses to claim his altcoins<br /><br />He loses his altcoins when he reclaims his deposit.&nbsp; Alice already has his Bitcoins by this point.<br /><br />He has an incentive to complete this step.<br /><br />7) Bob refuses to claim his deposit<br /><br />He loses his deposit and Alice gets it.<br /><br />He has an incentive to complete this step.<br /><br />For each step, there is either an incentive to complete the step or failure to complete the step causes the protocol to abort.&nbsp; In an abort, the incentives are to perform a clean abort.<br />###<br /><br />Where in the above can either party get funds from the other that they shouldnt be able to?<br /><br />James</div>

I dont think you are able to prove a negative statement, so we must stick to specific states that can be abused.<br /><br />The bitcoin utxo are protected by both the signatures that are required from the &quot;real&quot; privkey and the random number (alice_privM or bob_privN) from the protocol.<br /><br />So maybe there is a flaw with some script as stated, but you seem to not hear that there are TWO DIFFERENT privkeys required to do most of the spends. One of them is the temporary privkey from the 1000 cutandchoose keypairs. The OTHER privkey is one that is NEVER disclosed, only used to sign the tx to spend it.<br /><br />So the protocol does not allow anybody to spend it, only Bob can spend outputs meant for Bob and only Alice can spend output meant for her.<br /><br />Your assertion that anybody can spend the funds is missing the fact that only Alice has the privkey needed to sign the tx and only Bob has the privkey needed to sign the tx, and those privkeys are NOT disclosed<br /><br />James</div>

Bob can release his private key before step #4, thus refunding his deposit to himself and Alice&#039;s funds are forever locked because her block chain doesn&#039;t support CLTV.<br /></div>I am glad we are now finding potential weak spots in the actual protocol!<br /><br />Alice doesnt send the altpayment to the msig address until after she confirms the deposit is confirmed. Bob has to wait for maxtime period before he can claim it.<br /><br />Bob has the altpayment, but cant spend it at this point. But as you say, he can claim the deposit. But notice that in order to claim his deposit back, he must reveal the privM to spend the script:<br /><br />&nbsp; OP_HASH160 &lt;hash(bob_priv_n)&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY &lt;bob_pub_1001&gt; OP_CHECKSIG<br /><br />Alice then is waiting to see this on the blockchain and can then reclaim the altpayment. If Bob tries to wait alice out, then she is able to cash in the deposit as the CLTV timeout expires.<br /><br />This is why I implemented it as a state machine. That was as each step of the protocol is advanced, the choices to each side is limited and as near as we can tell, all paths lead to recovery of all funds or the trade completing.<br /><br />Of course, it is possible that there is an undetected flaw and we look forward to identification of the state and event that exposes this flaw. However if each state of the FSM has no specific flaw, then as unlikely as it is, the entire protocol must work. The fact it is done as FSM should actually allow a mathematical proof to be created, but such math (graph theory?) is beyond me.<br /><br />Once the FSM is validated, then as long as the code is properly detecting events then I think we get close to having a very solid and peer reviewed implementation.<br /><br />Clearly, loss of capital is the biggest potential flaw and it must be certain that no such thing is possible before delving into the secondary attacks about locking up funds for limited periods of time, etc.<br /><br />James</div>

The nodes simply store the ledger data to achieve decentralization and transparency. In other words, there are no &quot;mining&quot; incentives for nodes. <br /><br />If the above can be achieved, how do I set the packet time for the nodes? For example, Bitcoin Core is every 10 minutes. Where can I adjust this parameter?<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br /><br /></div>such changes make it an altcoin.<br />you need to change the network magic, default port, genesisblock/genesishash, blockhash algo, probably a good idea to change the address type for pubkey addresses and p2sh addresses<br /><br />If you dont want mining, a PoS fork would be closest to achieve what you want. There are even websites that automatically generate such a coin for you.<br /><br />But it is not bitcoin anymore and you would need to maintain whatever codebase you fork.<br /><br />James</div>
